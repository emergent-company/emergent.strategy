# ROADMAP Phase: Recipe for Solution
# This is the third sub-phase of READY where we create the actionable plan.
# 
# EPF v1.9.6 BREAKING CHANGE: Work packages removed from EPF.
# EPF now defines: Objectives → Key Results → Feature Definitions
# Spec-driven tools own: Work Packages → Tasks
#
# STRUCTURE: The roadmap is organized by TRACKS (Product, Strategy, Org/Ops, Commercial)
# to align with the four value models in the FIRE phase. Each track has its own OKRs,
# assumptions, and solution scaffold. Feature definitions (in FIRE phase) translate
# KR intent into capabilities that spec-driven tools consume.

roadmap:
  id: "roadmap-001"
  template_version: "1.9.6"
  strategy_id: "strat-001" # Links back to the strategy from 04_strategy_formula.yaml
  cycle: 1
  timeframe: "Q1 2025" # or "Sprint 1-3", etc.
  
  # TRACK-SPECIFIC ROADMAPS
  # Each track aligns with a value model: product.value_model.yaml, strategy.value_model.yaml, etc.
