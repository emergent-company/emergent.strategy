# Development Manager Scripts (Archived)

The dev-manager utilities are no longer part of the supported toolchain. They remain only as stubs that throw an error to guide developers towards the Workspace CLI workflow.

For current guidance, consult:

- `docs/DEV_PROCESS_MANAGER.md`
- `QUICK_START_DEV.md`
- `SETUP.md`

These documents cover the `workspace:*` scripts, PM2 supervision, and dependency management that replace the old approach.
