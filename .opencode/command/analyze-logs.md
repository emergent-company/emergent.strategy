# /analyze-logs

Perform a comprehensive analysis of all application and infrastructure logs from the last 3 hours, identifying issues and creating an actionable fix plan.

$ARGUMENTS

## User Arguments (Optional)

Interpret arguments as follows:

- **Time range**: "last hour", "last 30m", "last 6h" → adjust analysis window (default: 3h)
- **Severity filter**: "errors only", "critical" → focus on specific severity
- **Service filter**: "server", "admin", "postgres", "zitadel" → focus on specific logs

---

## Analysis Process

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Health Check

1. Use `workspace_get_status` to get overall health of services and dependencies
2. Note any unhealthy or degraded components for priority investigation

### Phase 2: Application Log Analysis

Collect logs from the last 3 hours (or user-specified range). Use `lines=500` for comprehensive coverage.

1. **Error Extraction**

   - Use `logs_get_errors` with `lines=100` to get recent errors
   - Look for: `ERROR`, `FATAL`, `Exception`, `Error:`, `failed`, `crash`

2. **Server Logs**

   - Use `logs_tail_server_logs` with `lines=500`
   - Look for: slow operations (>1000ms), repeated patterns, warnings

3. **HTTP Traffic**

   - Use `logs_tail_http_logs` with `lines=300`
   - Look for: 4xx/5xx responses, slow endpoints, repeated identical requests

4. **Admin/Frontend Logs**

   - Use `logs_tail_admin_logs` with `lines=200`
   - Look for: build errors, client-side exceptions, React errors

5. **Debug Logs** (if issues unclear)
   - Use `logs_tail_debug_logs` with `lines=200`
   - Look for: verbose warnings, edge case handling

### Phase 3: Infrastructure Container Logs

Check Docker container logs for infrastructure issues:

1. **Postgres**

   - Use `workspace_docker_logs` with `container=postgres`, `since=3h`, `lines=200`
   - Look for: connection errors, slow queries, deadlocks, disk space

2. **Zitadel (Auth)**

   - Use `workspace_docker_logs` with `container=zitadel`, `since=3h`, `lines=200`
   - Look for: auth failures, token errors, OIDC issues

3. **Langfuse**

   - Use `workspace_docker_logs` with `container=langfuse`, `since=3h`, `lines=100`
   - Look for: trace ingestion errors, API failures

4. **Redis** (if applicable)
   - Use `workspace_docker_logs` with `container=redis`, `since=3h`, `lines=100`
   - Look for: memory warnings, connection issues

### Phase 4: Observability Platform Analysis

1. **SigNoz Error Logs**

   - Use `signoz_get_error_logs` with `timeRange=3h`, `limit=50`
   - Correlate with application logs

2. **SigNoz Trace Errors**

   - Use `signoz_get_trace_error_analysis` with `timeRange=3h`
   - Identify error patterns across services

3. **Langfuse AI Traces**
   - Use `langfuse_list_traces` with `fromTimestamp` set to 3 hours ago, `limit=30`
   - Look for failed AI operations, high latency LLM calls

### Phase 5: Pattern Detection

While analyzing, specifically look for:

| Category        | Patterns                                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Errors**      | `ERROR`, `FATAL`, `Exception`, `ECONNREFUSED`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENOENT`      |
| **Duplicates**  | Identical messages within 1 min, repeated API calls, same error recurring |
| **Performance** | `>1000ms`, `slow`, `timeout`, `latency`, `took \d+ms`                     |
| **Security**    | `401`, `403`, `unauthorized`, `invalid token`, `authentication failed`    |
| **Resources**   | `memory`, `OOM`, `disk`, `quota`, `limit exceeded`                        |

### Severity Classification

- **🔴 Critical**: `FATAL`, unhandled exceptions, service unavailable, data loss risk, security breaches
- **🟠 Warning**: `ERROR` level, timeouts, repeated failures, auth issues, performance degradation
- **🔵 Info**: Slow operations, unusual patterns, potential optimizations

## Final Step: Create Fix Plan

After presenting the report, use the `TodoWrite` tool to create a prioritized task list for fixing the identified issues.

**Todo List Structure:**

- Group by priority (High → Medium → Low)
- Each todo should be actionable and specific
- Include the source/location of the issue
- Mark all as `pending` status

**Example:**

```
todos:
  - id: "fix-1"
    content: "[High] Fix database connection pool exhaustion in server logs - add connection timeout"
    status: "pending"
    priority: "high"
  - id: "fix-2"
    content: "[High] Investigate repeated 401 errors from Zitadel - check token refresh logic"
    status: "pending"
    priority: "high"
  - id: "fix-3"
    content: "[Medium] Optimize slow /api/objects endpoint (avg 2.3s) - add database index"
    status: "pending"
    priority: "medium"
  - id: "fix-4"
    content: "[Low] Remove duplicate API calls in admin client - implement request deduplication"
    status: "pending"
    priority: "low"
```

Inform the user that the fix plan has been created and they can proceed with implementation.

## Notes

- This is a **read-only analysis** - no files are modified
- Focus on **actionable insights**, not raw log dumps
- When in doubt about severity, classify as Warning (🟠)
- If no issues found, report a clean bill of health
- If user asks to "dig deeper" into a specific issue, use `search_logs` or `tail_log` for that specific pattern/file
