# Legacy Schema Files

These JSON schemas validated the original, simplified READY phase structure.

They have been **superseded** by:
- `insight_opportunity_schema.json` - Validates INSIGHT phase
- `strategy_formula_schema.json` - Validates STRATEGY phase
- `roadmap_recipe_schema.json` - Validates ROADMAP phase (replaces all three legacy schemas)

## Deprecated Schemas:
- `okrs_schema.json` - Now part of roadmap_recipe_schema.json
- `assumptions_schema.json` - Now part of roadmap_recipe_schema.json
- `work_packages_schema.json` - Now part of roadmap_recipe_schema.json

**Do not use these schemas.** They are kept only for historical reference.
