# EPF v1.13.0 - Track Health Signals Template
# Track Health Assessment (THA) - Signal Collection
# This is an EPHEMERAL artifact collected during each AIM cycle.
# Signals collected here are compared to living_reality_assessment.yaml baselines.
# If significant deltas detected, the living reality baseline is updated.
#
# Key principle: THA is the mechanism; Living Reality Assessment is the persistence.
# After analysis, THA can be discarded - changes flow into the baseline's evolution_log.
