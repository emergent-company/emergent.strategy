## Open Questions for Stakeholder Review

1. **Tone and Positioning:** Does the vision-first, philosophical approach resonate? Or should we lead with more concrete value props?

2. **Audience Segmentation:** Is the Builders vs. Leaders dichotomy clear and useful? Any additional audience segments to consider?

3. **Product Naming:** Are the names clear? (emergent.core, emergent.product, emergent.personal)

4. **Roadmap:** Should we emphasize future solutions (personal, research, consulting) or focus exclusively on core and product for now?

5. **Visual Direction:** Do the abstract visuals for the vision page align with brand expectations? Or should we use more literal product screenshots?

6. **Prioritization:** Should we fast-track implementation (Week 4) or invest more time in stakeholder feedback and iteration?

---

## Recommendations

### Proceed with Implementation

**Rationale:**

- All content complete and validated
- Strategy is coherent and well-documented
- Clear handoff to design and development teams
- Can iterate on live site faster than on documents

**Risk Mitigation:**

- Deploy to staging first
- A/B test headline variations
- Monitor engagement metrics closely
- Be prepared to adjust based on user feedback

### Consider Before Launch

1. **Stakeholder Alignment:** Brief internal stakeholders on vision-first strategy
2. **Brand Guidelines:** Ensure visual design aligns with brand expectations
3. **SEO Optimization:** Review metadata, page titles, descriptions
4. **Analytics Setup:** Implement tracking for engagement metrics
5. **Beta Waitlist:** Prepare infrastructure for future solution beta signups
