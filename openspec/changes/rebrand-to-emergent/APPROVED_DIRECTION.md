## Status: Ready to Begin Implementation

The value proposition and messaging have been refined and approved. This document captures the finalized direction.

## Core Message

### Primary Value Proposition

**"Effortless Mastery of Your Domain"**

### Key Differentiator

Emergent is **proactive intelligence** - it doesn't just answer when asked, it actively surfaces insights, connections, and context before you even know to look for them.

### The "Why" (High-Level Benefit)

- **Problem**: Organizations create knowledge faster than they can organize it. Manual knowledge management doesn't scale.
- **Solution**: Automatic organization, connections, and proactive surfacing of insights
- **Outcome**: Domain mastery without manual work. Real-time knowledge that works 24/7.

## Key Messaging Principles

### ✅ Do:

- Lead with outcomes and benefits
- Emphasize "automatic" and "proactive"
- Focus on effortless mastery
- Use clear, direct language
- Make it about the user's domain, not the technology

### ❌ Don't:

- Lead with technical features (embeddings, vectors, MCP)
- Use jargon before establishing value
- Focus on what the system does vs. what the user achieves
- Over-promise or use hyperbole

---

## Tone & Voice

- **Confident but not arrogant**: Let the value speak
- **Empowering**: You'll be smarter, faster, more effective
- **Clear over clever**: Direct language, no fluff
- **Human-centered**: About your expertise, not our technology

## Content Structure

1. **Hero** - Problem → Solution → Outcome
2. **Features** - Benefits, not capabilities (6 cards)
3. **Use Cases** - Real-world scenarios (4 examples)
4. **FAQ** - User-focused questions (6 questions)
5. **CTA** - Action-oriented call to get started
6. **Footer** - Branding and links

**Remove**: Technology stack, testimonials, bundle offers, template content

## Open Questions (Low Priority)

These don't block implementation but should be clarified:

1. **Logo Design Approach**: In-house, commission, or start with placeholder?
2. **Showcase Section**: Product screenshots, diagram, or remove entirely?
3. **Footer Links**: Specific URLs for GitHub, docs, contact?

**Decision**: Proceed with placeholders, refine later as assets become available.
