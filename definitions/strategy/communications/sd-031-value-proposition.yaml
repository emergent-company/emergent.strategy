definition:
  purpose: |
    Your value proposition is the answer to "Why should I care?" It's what makes 
    someone lean in or tune out in the first 30 seconds. Most value propositions 
    fail because they're too generic ("we help companies grow"), too feature-focused 
    ("AI-powered platform"), or too company-centric ("we're the leader in...").
    
    A strong value proposition:
    - Names the pain/desire (you understand me)
    - Promises a specific outcome (I see the benefit)
    - Differentiates (why you, not alternatives)
    - Is believable (I can trust this claim)
    
    This is NOT a tagline (those are creative). It's a strategic positioning 
    statement that informs all messaging. Every salesperson, every marketer, 
    every employee should be able to deliver a consistent value proposition.
    
  outcome: |
    A clear, differentiated value proposition that:
    - Converts strangers to interested prospects
    - Is consistent across all touchpoints
    - Resonates with target customers (validated)
    - Helps sales and marketing speak with one voice

        Pain: [What they're struggling with]
        Current solutions: [What they're doing now]
        Why those fail: [Gap in current solutions]
      example: |
        Target: "Marketing managers at 50-200 person B2B SaaS companies"
        Pain: "Can't prove marketing ROI to leadership"

    - step: 3
      action: Articulate promised outcome
      responsible: CEO + Marketing
      duration: "2-4 hours"
      deliverable: Outcome statement
      principles:
        - "Outcome, not feature (what they GET, not what product DOES)"
        - "Specific > generic ('reduce time by 50%' > 'save time')"
        - "Believable (can you prove it?)"

      action: Identify differentiation
      responsible: Product Marketing
      duration: "2-4 hours"
      deliverable: Differentiation statement
      questions:
        - "Why us instead of [competitor A]?"
        - "Why us instead of doing nothing?"
        - "Why us instead of building it themselves?"
        - "What can we claim that they can't?"

        - "Better outcomes (faster, cheaper, more effective)"
        - "Better experience (easier, more delightful)"
        - "Better fit (built for your specific use case)"
        - "Better credibility (team, customers, track record)"
      
    - step: 5

      test_questions:
        - "Is this specific enough that competitors can't claim it?"
        - "Does it promise an outcome I care about?"
        - "Is it believable?"
        - "Can I say it in 30 seconds?"
      
    - step: 6
      action: Validate with customers and market
      responsible: Product Marketing + Sales
      duration: "2-4 weeks"
      deliverable: Validated value proposition
      methods:
        - "Test on 10 prospects: 'Does this describe your problem?'"
        - "A/B test in emails or ads"
        - "Use in 20 sales calls, note reactions"
        - "Survey existing customers: 'Is this why you use us?'"
      iteration: |
        - If prospects don't recognize the pain → pain statement needs work
        - If outcome doesn't excite → not promising the right thing
        - If differentiation challenged → find sharper angle
      
    - step: 7
      action: Build messaging framework
      responsible: Product Marketing
      duration: "4-8 hours"
      deliverable: Complete messaging framework
      components:

        - "Persona variants (how to adjust for different audiences)"
        - "Competitive positioning (vs. key alternatives)"
        - "Objection responses (common pushbacks)"
        
    - step: 8

    - "Feature-focused → Ask 'so what?' until you get to outcome"
    - "Can't prove the claim → Start with softer claim, build evidence"
    - "Sales says it doesn't work → Validate with customers, not just internal opinion"

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Founder can't explain what they do"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: "10-person seed-stage startup, technical founder, product works but messaging is unclear"
    situation: |
      Raj (CEO, technical founder) has built a working product - an API for 
      identity verification. When someone asks "what does your company do?" 
      he gives a different answer every time. Sometimes it's technical ("We use 
      biometric signals to verify identity"), sometimes it's market-focused 
      ("We help companies comply with KYC regulations"), sometimes it's feature-
      focused ("We have face matching, document verification, and liveness 
      detection"). Investors and customers are confused.
    trigger: "Investor feedback: 'I don't understand what you do after 30 minutes'"
    actions: |
      1. Raj accepts he has a messaging problem, not a product problem. Decides 
         to block one week to fix it.
      2. Interviews 5 customers: "Why did you buy us?" Patterns emerge:
         - "We were getting fraud at sign-up"
         - "Compliance required it"
         - "Your API was easy to integrate"
         Never: "We needed biometric signals."
      3. Identifies the real customer pain: "Getting fraud at sign-up is costly 
         and manual review doesn't scale." That's the pain - not "needing identity 
         verification."
      4. Articulates outcome: "Stop sign-up fraud automatically." That's what 
         they actually GET.
      5. Finds differentiation: competitors are slow (2-day manual review) or 
         expensive ($5/verification). Raj's product is instant and $0.50. 
         Differentiation: "Instant and affordable."
      6. Drafts value proposition: "Stop sign-up fraud instantly, for $0.50 per 
         verification. Our API integrates in 2 hours, not 2 weeks."
      7. Tests with 5 new prospects: All 5 understood immediately. 3 said "that's 
         exactly our problem." 1 said "we're looking for more than just sign-up" 
         - okay, not target customer.
      8. Creates 30-second pitch, 2-minute version, and supporting proof points.
         Next investor meeting goes much better.
    outcome: |
      Meeting conversion rate doubled (25% to 50%). Investors understood immediately. 
      Sales calls got shorter - less time explaining, more time closing. Key learning: 
      customer words > founder words.
    lessons:
      - "If you can't explain it, it's a messaging problem, not a product problem"
      - "Interview customers - they'll tell you what value prop should be"
      - "Technical founders over-explain the 'how' instead of the 'what'"
      - "Simple > clever: 'Stop fraud for $0.50' beats 'biometric identity API'"
      - "Specificity helps: '$0.50' and '2 hours' are memorable"
      - "Test with new prospects, not existing customers (they're already bought in)"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Value proposition that doesn't differentiate"
    practitioner: "VP of Marketing"
    organization_context: "50-person Series B HR tech company, competing with 4-5 similar products, struggling to stand out"
    situation: |
      Sarah (VP Marketing) runs messaging for an HR tech company. Their value 
      proposition is "Simplify HR for growing companies." Problem: so is every 
      competitor's. In head-to-head deals, prospects can't articulate why they'd 
      choose Sarah's company over alternatives. Sales is frustrated: "Marketing 
      isn't giving us anything to work with."
    trigger: "Win rate dropped 15% as competition intensified; sales blames messaging"
    actions: |
      1. Sarah runs win/loss analysis on last 20 deals:
         - Wins: "Your onboarding module was better," "Customer support was great"
         - Losses: "Couldn't tell the difference," "Other one was cheaper"
         Insight: they're not losing on product, they're losing on positioning.
      2. Competitive analysis: lists what each competitor claims
         - All claim "simplify HR"
         - All claim "grow with you"
         - All claim "easy to use"
         No differentiation in any messaging.
      3. Digs deeper into wins: what ACTUALLY differentiated?
         - Onboarding module is genuinely better - can onboard 50 employees in 
           an hour vs. a day for competitors
         - Customer support: real humans, 15-minute response, vs. chatbots
      4. Creates new positioning around specific strength:
         "Onboard employees in under an hour, not a full day. HR that moves as 
         fast as you do."
      5. Builds proof: case study showing 50 employees onboarded in 45 minutes. 
         Customer quote: "We switched because your onboarding is 10x faster."
      6. Tests in next 10 sales calls. Win rate: 7/10 vs. previous 4/10.
         Prospects say: "Speed matters to us."
      7. Cascades across marketing: website, pitch deck, ads all focus on 
         "fast onboarding" angle. Support team trained to highlight 
         "15-minute response."
    outcome: |
      Win rate improved from 40% to 65% in competitive deals. Positioning became 
      ownable - competitors couldn't claim "onboard in an hour" because their 
      products couldn't do it. Key learning: differentiation must be PROVABLE.
    lessons:
      - "Generic value props don't work in competitive markets"
      - "Win/loss analysis reveals what actually differentiates"
      - "Claims must be provable - can you show evidence?"
      - "Specific > general: 'onboard in an hour' beats 'simplify HR'"
      - "One strong differentiator > three weak ones"
      - "Test in real sales calls - that's where truth emerges"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Value proposition that works for sales, fails for marketing"
    practitioner: "Product Marketing Manager"
    organization_context: "30-person SaaS, sales team has great pitch, but marketing can't translate to website and ads"
    situation: |
      Dina (PMM) has a problem: sales has a great pitch that closes deals, but 
      she can't translate it to marketing. When the CEO demos live, prospects 
      light up. But the website conversion rate is terrible (0.5%), and ads 
      underperform. The value proposition that works in conversation doesn't 
      work in print.
    trigger: "Website conversion 0.5% despite product-market fit in sales; marketing vs. sales disconnect"
    actions: |
      1. Dina shadows 5 sales calls to understand what actually resonates:
         - Live demo of one feature: "Watch this" moment
         - Story about how another customer solved exact problem
         - CEO's passion and credibility
         Problem: none of this translates to a website headline.
      2. Identifies the gap: sales pitch is experiential and relational, 
         website is declarative and impersonal.
      3. Creates bridge: What's the ONE thing that makes prospects lean in during 
         demo? Answer: "You can do in 5 minutes what took 2 hours before."
      4. Rewrites website headline: Old: "The modern data platform for teams"
         New: "Do in 5 minutes what takes 2 hours. See how."
      5. Adds video of the "Watch this" demo moment - the 30 seconds that 
         captures the value.
      6. Adds customer story carousel - same stories sales tells, now on website.
      7. Replaces generic credibility section with CEO's specific background: 
         "Built by a former [role] who felt your pain."
      8. A/B tests: New version converts at 1.8% vs. 0.5% - 3.6x improvement.
    outcome: |
      Website conversion tripled. Marketing and sales now aligned on same core 
      message. Key insight: the value prop was RIGHT, but the FORMAT was wrong 
      for different channels.
    lessons:
      - "What works in conversation might not work in text - format matters"
      - "Shadow sales calls to find the 'lean in' moment"
      - "Specific > abstract: '5 minutes vs. 2 hours' beats 'modern platform'"
      - "Video can capture what text can't - the 'Watch this' moment"
      - "Customer stories work in text if done right"
      - "Test, don't assume - conversion data reveals truth"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Value proposition too generic"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Push for specificity: can competitors claim the same thing? If yes, not 
        differentiated. Use customer words, not marketing words. Include specific 
        outcomes and numbers when possible.
        
    - risk: "Value proposition not validated"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Test with real prospects, not just internal opinion. A/B test where 
        possible. Track win/loss for messaging effectiveness. Don't fall in 
        love with words - fall in love with what works.
        
    - risk: "Different teams use different messaging"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Create messaging framework and distribute. Train sales explicitly.
        Review new content for consistency. Have one owner for messaging.
        Audit quarterly: are people actually using it?
        
    - risk: "Feature-focused instead of outcome-focused"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Ask "so what?" for every feature claim until you get to customer outcome.
        "We have AI" → so what? → "It saves time" → so what? → "You get answers 
        in 5 minutes not 2 hours" → THAT's the value prop.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Positioning doesn't match reality"
      impact: |
        Customers feel misled. Churn increases. Sales makes promises product 
        can't keep. Internal frustration grows. Trust erodes.
      prevention: |
        Value proposition must be TRUE and PROVABLE. If you can't back it up, 
        don't claim it. Involve product in messaging development. Customer 
        success should validate claims before marketing uses them.
        
    - risk: "Positioning becomes outdated"
      impact: |
        Market moves, positioning doesn't. Competitors copy your angle.
        New products/capabilities not reflected in messaging. Lost relevance.
      prevention: |
        Annual positioning review minimum. Refresh after major product launches.
        Monitor competitive messaging. Track if value prop still resonates in 
        sales calls. Don't let good messaging ossify.
