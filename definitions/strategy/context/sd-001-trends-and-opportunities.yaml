definition:
  purpose: |
    Trends shape the playing field. Missing a trend means building for yesterday's 
    market. Spotting trends early creates positioning advantage. This process 
    captures what's changing in the world that affects your company - technology 
    shifts, regulatory changes, behavioral patterns, competitive movements - and 
    translates them into strategic implications.
    
    The goal isn't prediction (impossible) but preparation (scanning for signals) 
    and positioning (making bets on futures you believe in). Good trend analysis 
    creates "prepared minds" - when the opportunity arrives, you're ready.
    
    Common failure modes:
    - Reading trends but not acting (interesting but not actionable)
    - Chasing every trend (shiny object syndrome)
    - Missing trends hiding in plain sight (too close to see)
    - Confusing hype with substance (trend vs. fad)
    
  outcome: |
    The leadership team has shared understanding of key trends affecting the 
    business. Strategic bets are informed by trend analysis. New opportunities 
    are identified before competitors. The company is positioned for where the 
    market is going, not just where it is.

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Founder spots adjacent market shift early"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: "8-person B2B SaaS, selling to marketing teams, founder maintains industry awareness"
    situation: |
      Jai (CEO) runs a marketing analytics platform. He's been watching the rise of 
      "RevOps" as a function - marketing, sales, and CS ops converging. His product 
      is squarely in marketing, but customers keep asking "does this connect to 
      Salesforce?" and "can we see the full funnel?" He's not sure if this is a 
      trend (structural shift) or noise (individual requests).
    trigger: "Multiple customer requests + industry buzz about 'RevOps' - is this real?"
    actions: |
      1. Jai starts tracking signals systematically instead of just noting them:
         - 4 out of 10 recent sales calls mentioned RevOps
         - 3 competitors have "RevOps" in their positioning now
         - RevOps community on Slack grew from 2K to 15K in 6 months
         - "Chief Revenue Officer" job postings up 200% YoY
      2. Deep-reads 5 articles/reports on RevOps. Finds: companies doing RevOps 
         see 20% faster deal cycles. This isn't just a buzzword - there's 
         functional consolidation happening.
      3. Interviews 3 customers: "Is RevOps happening at your company?"
         - Company A: "Yes, we just merged marketing ops into RevOps team"
         - Company B: "We're planning to in 6 months"
         - Company C: "What's RevOps?" (smaller company, trailing indicator)
      4. Creates trend hypothesis: "Marketing ops is consolidating into RevOps. 
         If true, our buyers will change (CMO → CRO), our use case will expand 
         (marketing analytics → revenue analytics), and we'll compete with 
         Salesforce ecosystem more directly."
      5. Tests hypothesis:
         - Builds simple Salesforce connector as experiment
         - Runs "Revenue Analytics" positioning with 10 prospects
         - Results: 2x response rate to RevOps positioning vs. marketing positioning
      6. Strategy implication: repositions company from "Marketing Analytics" to 
         "Revenue Analytics for Modern RevOps Teams." Begins Salesforce integration 
         as serious product investment.
    outcome: |
      Company repositioned 6 months before major competitor made the same move. 
      The early signal (customer requests) was validated by systematic analysis, 
      then tested through experiments. New positioning increased demo conversion 
      by 40%. Key learning: customer requests can be leading indicators of trends.
    lessons:
      - "Multiple weak signals can add up to strong signal"
      - "Validate signals with data (job postings, community growth, competitor moves)"
      - "Interview customers to understand if signal is leading or lagging"
      - "Form testable hypothesis: 'If true, then...'"
      - "Test positioning before committing to product investment"
      - "First mover to new positioning creates advantage"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Missing a trend hiding in plain sight"
    practitioner: "VP of Product"
    organization_context: "60-person Series B, enterprise collaboration tool, missed AI shift that competitors caught"
    situation: |
      Lauren (VP Product) looks back and realizes her company missed the AI wave 
      for 12+ months. When ChatGPT launched, they called it "hype." When competitors 
      added AI features, they said "gimmicks." Now customers are churning because 
      "your product doesn't have AI." The trend was visible, but they explained it 
      away. She's determined not to make this mistake again.
    trigger: "Post-mortem on why they missed AI trend; building better process"
    actions: |
      1. Lauren runs a brutally honest retrospective: why did they miss it?
         - "We were too close - dismissed it as hype"
         - "We didn't have customers asking (lagging indicator)"
         - "Our tech team said it wasn't real"
         - "No one owned trend tracking - everyone assumed someone else watched"
      2. Creates formal "trend radar" process:
         - Monthly meeting to review signals
         - Required input from sales, support, and engineering
         - Explicit check: "What are we dismissing that might be real?"
         - External input required (advisors, investors, customer council)
      3. Establishes the "9 months rule": any trend mentioned 3+ times in 
         external conversations gets a 2-hour deep dive within 2 weeks.
      4. Creates "devil's advocate" role in trend discussions: one person must 
         argue the opposite position. If everyone agrees "this is hype," devil's 
         advocate argues "what if it's real?"
      5. Adds competitive intelligence to trend tracking: when 2+ competitors 
         adopt something, it triggers mandatory analysis (not automatic follow, 
         but forced consideration).
      6. Tests process: 6 months later, spots "agentic AI" trend early. Instead 
         of dismissing, does deep dive. Launches prototype in 6 weeks - ahead of 
         most competitors this time.
    outcome: |
      Missed AI wave was expensive (lost 15% of customers). But the process fix 
      caught the next wave early. Key insight: the trend was visible, but 
      confirmation bias and lack of ownership let them dismiss it. Structured 
      process forces consideration.
    lessons:
      - "Trends are often visible before they're obvious - bias hides them"
      - "Internal consensus to dismiss should trigger questioning, not comfort"
      - "Sales and support hear signals before product recognizes them"
      - "Competitor actions as forcing function - if 2+ act, you must analyze"
      - "Devil's advocate role combats groupthink"
      - "Ownership matters - 'everyone's job' means 'no one's job'"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Turning trend analysis into strategic bet"
    practitioner: "CEO / Strategy Lead"
    organization_context: "25-person Series A fintech, has trend radar but struggles to translate into action"
    situation: |
      Amit (CEO) has a good trend tracking process - monthly reviews, documented 
      radar, cross-functional input. But he's frustrated: "We analyze trends but 
      don't DO anything. It's interesting but not actionable." The team knows 
      embedded finance is a trend, knows regulatory tailwinds favor them, but 
      hasn't changed strategy based on this knowledge.
    trigger: "Realization that trend analysis is producing reports, not action"
    actions: |
      1. Amit diagnoses the gap: trends are described but not connected to decisions. 
         The question "so what?" isn't being answered.
      2. Restructures trend review:
         - Old format: "Here are trends we're tracking"
         - New format: "Here's a trend. Here's our hypothesis about it. Here's 
           what we should DO if we believe it."
      3. Creates "Strategic Bet" template for each trend:
         - Trend: [What's happening]
         - Our hypothesis: [Why this matters to us specifically]
         - If we're right: [What opportunity exists]
         - Bet: [Specific action we're taking to capture opportunity]
         - Validation: [How we'll know if the bet is right]
         - Timeline: [When we'll know]
      4. Applies to "embedded finance" trend:
         - Trend: Non-finance companies embedding finance (Shopify, Toast, etc.)
         - Hypothesis: SMBs prefer finance inside existing workflows, not separate
         - If right: Our API-first approach is perfect; integrate with SMB platforms
         - Bet: Build 3 integrations with major SMB platforms in 6 months
         - Validation: 100 customers acquired through integrations
         - Timeline: 6 months
      5. Makes bets explicit to board: "We're making these 3 bets based on trends. 
         Here's how we'll validate. Here's what we'll do if we're wrong."
      6. Tracks bets like OKRs: monthly review of bet progress, not just trend status.
    outcome: |
      Within 6 months, embedded finance bet proved right - 150 customers through 
      integrations, faster than direct sales. Trend analysis became valuable 
      because it drove action. Board loved the "bets" framing - made strategy 
      transparent and testable.
    lessons:
      - "Trend analysis without 'so what' is expensive curiosity"
      - "Force every trend discussion to end with an action or explicit decision to wait"
      - "Strategic bets make implicit assumptions explicit"
      - "Treat bets like hypotheses - define validation upfront"
      - "Board/investors appreciate transparency about bets"
      - "Track bet outcomes as seriously as financials"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Analysis paralysis - too much information, no action"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Force every trend review to end with "so what?" Require action or 
        explicit decision to wait. Set time limits on analysis before decision. 
        Use strategic bet framework to translate analysis into action.
        
    - risk: "Chasing every trend - shiny object syndrome"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Have clear strategic filter: "Does this trend affect our core thesis?"
        Limit to 3-5 trends actively tracked. Say no explicitly to others.
        Remember: you can't follow every trend and still have focus.
        
    - risk: "Confirmation bias - seeing what you want to see"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Require devil's advocate in trend discussions. Seek disconfirming evidence
        explicitly. Include diverse perspectives (not just leadership).
        Question consensus too quickly reached.
        
    - risk: "Trends become stale - radar not updated"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Assign clear owner for trend process. Monthly cadence is mandatory.
        Remove trends that are no longer relevant. The radar should feel alive.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Miss a major industry shift"
      impact: |
        Company is positioned for yesterday's market. Competitors who caught the 
        trend gain advantage. Customers churn to more forward-looking products.
        Recovery is expensive and slow.
      prevention: |
        Multiple input sources (not just leadership intuition). External 
        perspectives (advisors, customers, investors). Competitive intelligence 
        as forcing function. "What are we dismissing?" as explicit question.
        
    - risk: "Trend analysis becomes bureaucracy"
      impact: |
        Team produces reports no one reads. Meetings become box-checking.
        Best people opt out. Real strategic conversations happen elsewhere.
        Process exists but provides no value.
      prevention: |
        Tie trends to decisions - if analysis doesn't drive action, question it.
        Keep process light (2-4 hours/month, not 2-4 days). Kill rituals that 
        don't add value. Ask "would we miss this if we stopped?"
