# Strategy Definitions

Strategy definitions for strategists and leadership. These are canonical templates usable by any organization to produce strategic artifacts.

## Purpose

Strategy definitions are **input** for strategists to produce:
- READY phase artifacts (North Star, Strategy Formula, Roadmap)
- Strategic communications
- Alignment documents

## Categories (by L1 Value Model Layer)

### Strategic Roadmap
Vision, goal prioritization, long-term initiatives.

### Tactical Roadmap
Actionable priorities, execution plans, feedback loops.

### Strategic Communications
Identity, positioning, narrative building, engagement.
