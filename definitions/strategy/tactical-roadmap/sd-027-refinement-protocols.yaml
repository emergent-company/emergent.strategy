  tier_1_basic:
    description: "Minimal viable approach to refinement protocols"
    includes:
      - Basic documentation
      - Ad-hoc execution
      - Manual tracking
    effort: "2-4 hours initial setup"
    
  tier_2_intermediate:
    description: "Structured and repeatable process"
    adds:
      - Standardized templates
      - Regular cadence
      - Basic metrics
      - Stakeholder communication
    effort: "1-2 weeks to establish"
    
  tier_3_advanced:
    description: "Optimized and integrated approach"
    adds:
      - Automated workflows
      - Advanced analytics
      - Cross-functional integration
      - Continuous improvement
    effort: "1-2 months full implementation"

definition:
  purpose: |
    Strategic processes require clear documentation and consistent execution. Without structured refinement protocols, organizations struggle to maintain alignment and make informed decisions.
    
  outcome: |
    Clear, documented approach to refinement protocols that enables consistent strategic execution and organizational alignment.

practitioner_scenarios:
  startup_founder:
    context: "Early-stage founder managing refinement protocols personally"
    approach: "Start with Tier 1, focus on documenting decisions for future reference"
    time_investment: "2-4 hours/week initially"
    
  scale_up_leader:
    context: "Growing team needs more structure around refinement protocols"
    approach: "Implement Tier 2 with clear ownership and cadence"
    time_investment: "Dedicated role or significant time allocation"
    
  enterprise_executive:
    context: "Large organization optimizing refinement protocols"
    approach: "Full Tier 3 with automation and integration"
    time_investment: "Cross-functional team effort"

risks:
  if_skipped: "Inconsistent execution, missed opportunities, organizational misalignment"
  if_over_engineered: "Analysis paralysis, slow decision-making, excessive overhead"
