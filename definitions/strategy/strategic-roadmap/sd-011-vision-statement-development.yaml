definition:
  purpose: |
    A vision statement answers: "What does the future look like if we succeed?" It's 
    the destination, not the journey. While mission defines what you do today, vision 
    describes the world you're working toward.
    
    A strong vision statement:
    - Is ambitious but achievable (10-25 year horizon)
    - Paints a picture of a different future
    - Inspires and motivates stakeholders
    - Guides strategic decisions ("Does this get us closer to the vision?")
    - Is specific enough to differentiate (not "make the world better")
    
    Warning signs of weak vision:
    - Could describe any company in your industry
    - Doesn't survive the "and do what?" test
    - Team can't recite it or explain it
    - Doesn't inform any actual decisions
    
  outcome: |
    A vision statement that:
    - Inspires and aligns the team
    - Differentiates from competitors
    - Guides strategic choices
    - Attracts talent and investors who share the aspiration

        - "'So what?' test: Does it inspire or just describe?"
        - "Decision test: Would this help choose between two strategies?"
        - "10-year test: Is this still inspiring in 10 years?"
      refinement:
        - "If too vague → Add specificity (who, what, how much)"
        - "If too tactical → Zoom out (what's the world we're creating?)"
        - "If too similar to competitors → Find your unique angle"

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Technical founder needs a vision beyond the product"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder (Technical)"
    organization_context: "15-person seed-stage B2B startup, founder is strong on product but vision is unclear"
    situation: |
      Marcus (CEO, technical founder) has built a great product - an AI-powered 
      data pipeline tool. When asked about vision, he says things like "build the 
      best data pipeline product" or "help data teams move faster." The team is 
      motivated by the technology but unclear on the bigger picture. Investors 
      keep asking "what's the long-term vision?" and Marcus struggles to articulate 
      something inspiring. New hires ask "where is this company going?" and get 
      vague answers.
    trigger: "Investor asks 'Where do you see this in 10 years?' and Marcus stumbles"
    actions: |
      1. Marcus realizes he needs to articulate a vision beyond "great product." 
         Blocks 2 days to work on this.
      2. Starts with purpose: Why did he start this company? Answer: "Spent years 
         watching data teams struggle with plumbing instead of analysis. Frustrating 
         to see smart people doing dumb work."
      3. Interviews 5 customers: "What would your world look like if data was easy?"
         Patterns: "We could focus on insights, not infrastructure." "We'd be 
         strategic partners, not maintenance workers." "We'd finally prove our value."
      4. Thinks about the future: If we succeed completely, what's different? 
         "Data teams are strategic, not operational. They're valued, not overlooked."
      5. Drafts candidates:
         - "A world where data teams are heroes, not plumbers"
         - "Every data team becomes a strategic driver of the business"
         - "Transform data teams from cost centers to growth engines"
      6. Tests with team: "Data teams as heroes" resonates most. Expands to:
         "A world where every data team is recognized as a strategic driver 
         of business growth."
      7. Builds narrative: "Today, data teams spend 80% of time on plumbing and 
         20% on insights. We're flipping that ratio. When data is easy, data 
         teams become strategic advisors, not infrastructure maintainers."
      8. Rolls out at all-hands. Team energized - they're not just building tools, 
         they're changing how data teams are valued.
    outcome: |
      Clear vision that goes beyond product features. Team aligned on bigger 
      purpose. Investor conversations became clearer - they understand the 
      long-term aspiration. Key learning: Vision is about the world you're 
      creating, not the product you're building.
    lessons:
      - "Technical founders often stop at 'great product' - push for 'great outcome'"
      - "Customer interviews reveal what they really want (status, not just features)"
      - "Vision is about transformation in the world, not product capabilities"
      - "Test candidates with the team - what energizes them?"
      - "Vision makes fundraising easier - investors buy futures"
      - "Narrative is as important as the statement itself"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Post-pivot company needs vision refresh"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: "60-person Series A company, recently pivoted from B2C to B2B, old vision no longer fits"
    situation: |
      Elena (CEO) led a successful pivot 6 months ago. The old vision was "Make 
      personal finance fun for everyone." Now they're selling B2B expense 
      management. The old vision is still on the website, in the pitch deck, 
      everywhere. It's confusing - employees don't know what to say, the 
      marketing team is stuck. Some original team members joined for the B2C 
      vision and are questioning fit.
    trigger: "Marketing asks 'What should our new website say?' and no one has an answer"
    actions: |
      1. Elena acknowledges the problem: "We pivoted the business but not the 
         vision. That's on me." Schedules vision development as top priority.
      2. Takes stock of what changed: New customer (B2B CFOs), new problem 
         (expense chaos), new value (visibility and control). What stayed: 
         belief that finance should be simple.
      3. Interviews B2B customers: "What does success look like for you?"
         Answers: "Complete visibility." "No surprises at quarter-end." "CFO 
         looks like a hero, not a gatekeeper."
      4. Identifies the thread between B2C and B2B: Making finance simple and 
         empowering, whether for individuals or companies.
      5. Drafts new vision candidates:
         - "A world where finance empowers, never constrains"
         - "Every CFO a strategic partner, not a cop"
         - "Financial clarity for every company, from startup to enterprise"
      6. Tests with leadership team. Lands on: "A world where finance empowers 
         every organization to grow confidently."
      7. Addresses the team: "Our vision evolved because our understanding 
         evolved. The core belief remains: finance should empower, not constrain. 
         Here's how our new vision captures that for B2B."
      8. Updates all materials: website, pitch deck, job descriptions, onboarding.
         Some team members who joined for B2C decide to leave - that's okay, 
         better clarity for everyone.
    outcome: |
      New vision that bridges past and future. Team aligned on B2B direction.
      Lost 3 team members who preferred B2C mission - but gained clarity.
      Marketing can now speak with one voice. Key learning: Pivot the vision 
      when you pivot the business.
    lessons:
      - "When the business pivots, the vision must follow"
      - "Find the thread that connects old and new - helps transition team"
      - "Be honest: some team members won't fit the new vision"
      - "Don't just change the statement - update ALL materials"
      - "Address the change directly with the team - don't let it drift"
      - "New vision enables new marketing, hiring, strategy"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Vision is ignored and gathering dust"
    practitioner: "COO"
    organization_context: "150-person Series B company, vision exists but nobody uses it"
    situation: |
      Omar (COO) notices that despite having a vision statement, nobody references 
      it. It's on the website: "Empowering the next generation of builders." But 
      in strategic meetings, no one mentions it. New hires can't recall it. When 
      asked about priorities, people talk about OKRs, not vision. The vision has 
      become wallpaper - decorative but meaningless. CEO is frustrated: "Why 
      doesn't anyone care about the vision?"
    trigger: "CEO asks at all-hands 'What's our vision?' and gets silence"
    actions: |
      1. Omar diagnoses the problem: The vision isn't bad, but it's disconnected 
         from daily reality. Nobody sees how it connects to their work.
      2. Surveys team (anonymous): "Can you state our vision? What does it mean 
         to you? How does your work connect?" Results: 30% can state it, 15% 
         see connection to their work.
      3. Works with CEO to revitalize, not replace. The vision is fine - the 
         problem is operationalization.
      4. Creates vision connection framework:
         - How each team contributes to "empowering builders"
         - Specific examples: "Product team: build tools that simplify creation"
         - Quarterly connection: "How did we empower builders this quarter?"
      5. Integrates vision into existing rhythms:
         - All-hands: CEO spends 5 min on vision progress
         - OKR setting: "How does this OKR advance our vision?"
         - Performance reviews: "How did this person embody our vision?"
      6. Creates visual representation: Progress toward vision milestones.
         "We've empowered 50,000 builders. Next milestone: 100,000."
      7. CEO records 10-minute video explaining vision deeply. Required 
         watching for new hires.
      8. After 6 months: Re-survey shows 80% can state vision, 60% see 
         connection to their work. Still improving.
    outcome: |
      Vision went from wallpaper to working tool. Team can articulate and 
      connect to it. Decisions reference vision. Key learning: A vision 
      without operationalization is just decoration.
    lessons:
      - "Vision on the wall isn't vision in the culture"
      - "Connection to daily work is what makes vision matter"
      - "Embed in existing rhythms (OKRs, reviews, all-hands)"
      - "Make it measurable where possible"
      - "CEO must be primary champion and repeat constantly"
      - "New hires are opportunity to embed vision early"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Vision is too vague"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Push for specificity. If competitors could claim it, it's too vague.
        Include who, what, or how much. "Help people" → "Financial inclusion 
        for 1 billion underbanked people."
        
    - risk: "Vision doesn't inspire"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Test with real people - does it make them lean in? If vision gets 
        polite nods but not excitement, it needs work. Great visions make 
        people want to join the mission.
        
    - risk: "Team doesn't understand or remember"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Simplify until memorable. Build narrative that explains. CEO must 
        repeat constantly. Test comprehension regularly. If people can't 
        remember it, it's not working.
        
    - risk: "Vision becomes outdated"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Annual review: Is this still inspiring? Still relevant? Still 
        differentiated? Refresh when needed, but don't change too often 
        (team whiplash).
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Vision is CEO's alone"
      impact: |
        Team doesn't feel ownership. Vision feels imposed rather than shared.
        People comply rather than commit. Cynicism grows.
      prevention: |
        Include team in development (input, not decision). Explain the 'why' 
        behind the vision. Create space for discussion and questions. Let 
        people find their own connection to it.
        
    - risk: "Vision/reality gap"
      impact: |
        Team sees hypocrisy. Decisions contradict stated vision. Cynicism 
        replaces inspiration. "We say X but do Y."
      prevention: |
        Reference vision in actual decisions. Call out when decisions are 
        hard because of vision trade-offs. Admit when falling short and 
        course-correct. Consistency builds credibility.
