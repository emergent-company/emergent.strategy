definition:
  purpose: |
    Purpose is the answer to "Why does this organization exist beyond making money?" 
    It's the North Star that guides decisions when the path is unclear. Without 
    articulated purpose, organizations drift based on whoever has the loudest voice, 
    lose talent who crave meaning, and make inconsistent decisions.
    
    Good purpose is:
    - Enduring (won't change with strategy pivots)
    - Inspiring (makes people want to join/stay)
    - Distinctive (not generic "make the world better")
    - Guiding (actually helps make decisions)
    
    This is NOT a marketing tagline. It's an internal compass that should make 
    some opportunities obviously wrong and others obviously right.
    
  outcome: |
    The organization has a clear, written statement of purpose that:
    - Every employee can articulate in their own words
    - Guides strategic decisions and trade-offs
    - Attracts people aligned with the mission
    - Remains stable even as tactics change

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Two co-founders with different 'why'"
    practitioner: "CEO / Co-founder"
    organization_context: "6-person pre-seed startup, two technical co-founders, never articulated purpose beyond 'building cool tech'"
    situation: |
      Mira (CEO) and James (CTO) co-founded an AI startup 8 months ago. They met 
      in grad school, loved building together, and saw an opportunity in AI for 
      legal research. As they're preparing for seed fundraise, an advisor asks: 
      "What's your mission?" They give different answers. Mira cares about access 
      to justice. James cares about building the best AI. This difference is 
      starting to cause friction in product decisions.
    trigger: "Investor question revealed misalignment; product decisions becoming contentious"
    actions: |
      1. Mira proposes a half-day offsite to align on purpose. James initially 
         resists ("we know what we're building"), but agrees after Mira frames 
         it as "we're about to hire 5 more people who need to know why."
      2. Each spends 2 hours writing answers to reflection questions before 
         offsite. Both are surprised by the other's answers.
      3. At offsite, discover shared thread: both had experiences where legal 
         complexity created unfair outcomes. James's family lost a house to 
         legal fees in a frivolous lawsuit. Mira's parents, immigrants, were 
         exploited by predatory contract terms.
      4. Find common purpose: "Legal knowledge shouldn't be a privilege of the 
         wealthy." This captures both the justice angle and the technology as 
         democratizer.
      5. Test purpose against recent decisions: Should they sell to BigLaw 
         firms (lucrative) or focus on access-to-justice orgs (mission-aligned)?
         Purpose doesn't dictate answer, but frames the trade-off clearly.
      6. Write it up, share with team of 4 others. Get feedback: one engineer 
         says "this is why I joined." Another pushes for more precision on "who" 
         they're serving.
      7. Refine to: "Legal knowledge shouldn't be a privilege. We're building AI 
         so everyone can understand their rights and options."
    outcome: |
      Mira and James are now aligned on the "why" even when they disagree on 
      the "how." Product decisions are less contentious because they can reference 
      purpose. Seed pitch is stronger because purpose is authentic and specific. 
      First 3 hires all mention purpose as a draw.
    lessons:
      - "Technical co-founders often haven't articulated why - doesn't mean they don't care"
      - "Different motivations can converge on shared purpose"
      - "Writing before talking surfaces real differences"
      - "Purpose should help frame trade-offs, not make all decisions obvious"
      - "Team input strengthens and validates purpose"
      - "Specific > generic: 'legal knowledge' beats 'make the world better'"

    name: "Purpose drift after rapid scaling"
    practitioner: "Chief People Officer"
    organization_context: "180-person Series B fintech, grew 4x in 18 months, original purpose feels disconnected from daily work"
    situation: |
      Aaliyah (CPO) notices something wrong. In engagement surveys, "I understand 
      the company's mission" dropped from 85% to 62% in one year. In exit interviews, 
      departing employees say "it's just another fintech now." The original purpose - 
      "financial freedom for the underbanked" - is still on the website, but most 
      employees were hired to build B2B features for banks. Aaliyah suspects purpose 
      has drifted, or was never truly held.
    trigger: "Engagement scores drop, exit interview patterns suggest mission disconnect"
    actions: |
      1. Aaliyah reviews company history: founders did care about financial 
         inclusion, but pivoted to B2B banking software to survive. Original 
         purpose never updated.
      2. Interviews 15 employees across tenure: long-timers feel "we lost our 
         way," new hires "never knew we had a different purpose."
      3. Raises to CEO: "We have a stated purpose that doesn't match reality. 
         Either we recommit to it or we need to articulate what we actually are."
      4. CEO and founders hold honest session: "Do we still believe in financial 
         inclusion, or is that aspirational now?" Conclusion: they believe it, 
         but current strategy is a stepping stone, not the destination.
      5. Reframe purpose: "Financial infrastructure for a more inclusive economy."
         This honors both the B2B work (infrastructure) and the original intent 
         (inclusion). It's true today AND aspirational.
      6. Launch "Back to Purpose" internal campaign:
         - CEO video explaining the journey and renewed commitment
         - All-hands Q&A on what this means practically
         - Product team identifies 3 features that advance inclusion directly
         - Partner with 2 access-focused fintechs as first non-bank customers
      7. Update onboarding to include purpose journey, not just current state.
    outcome: |
      Next engagement survey: "understand mission" back to 78%. More importantly, 
      product roadmap now includes inclusion-focused features. Two new hires 
      specifically cited the renewed purpose. Key learning: purpose must evolve 
      with strategy, not be frozen in founding moment.
    lessons:
      - "Purpose drift happens gradually - needs active monitoring"
      - "Pivot to survive doesn't mean abandoning purpose - find the connection"
      - "Stated purpose that doesn't match reality is worse than no stated purpose"
      - "Recommitment requires visible action, not just words"
      - "New hires need to understand the purpose journey, not just endpoint"
      - "B2B can serve consumer purpose - 'infrastructure' framing connects them"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Founder departure forces purpose clarity"
    practitioner: "CEO (successor)"
    organization_context: "50-person Series A edtech, original founder departing, purpose was founder-embodied, not documented"
    situation: |
      David (new CEO, promoted from COO) takes over when founder Priya exits for 
      health reasons. Priya was the company's purpose personified - she talked 
      about "democratizing education" in every all-hands, every pitch, every hire. 
      But it was never written down. David realizes he can't be Priya, and the 
      team is looking to him to carry the torch. He needs to institutionalize 
      purpose before Priya's departure creates a vacuum.
    trigger: "Founder health exit; purpose was person-dependent, not documented"
    actions: |
      1. David asks Priya to spend her last month helping document what's in her 
         head. She's resistant - "it's obvious, everyone knows" - but agrees.
      2. Conducts "exit interview" with Priya focused on purpose:
         - "What decisions did you make because of purpose?"
         - "What opportunities did you turn down?"
         - "What do you want people to remember?"
      3. Interviews 8 employees: "What do you think Priya would say our purpose is?"
         Answers vary significantly. Some focused on product, some on impact, 
         some on culture.
      4. Runs purpose workshop with leadership + Priya (her last week):
         - Synthesize all input
         - Draft purpose statement
         - Have Priya validate: "Yes, that's what I meant"
      5. Purpose crystallizes: "Everyone deserves access to learning that changes 
         their life. Education shouldn't depend on your zip code."
      6. Creates "Priya Stories" - documented examples of Priya's purpose-driven 
         decisions. These become onboarding material.
      7. David commits to his own interpretation: he can't be Priya, but he can 
         carry the torch in his own way. First all-hands post-transition, he 
         shares purpose, shares Priya stories, and shares his personal connection.
    outcome: |
      Transition succeeded without purpose vacuum. Long-tenured employees felt 
      Priya's legacy was honored. New employees got the "why" even though they 
      never worked with Priya. David found his own voice for purpose, not 
      imitating Priya. Key learning: purpose must be documented, not just embodied.
    lessons:
      - "Founder-embodied purpose is fragile - must be documented"
      - "Interview the founder as if they're leaving (even if not)"
      - "Employee interpretations reveal what's actually been communicated"
      - "Stories and examples preserve purpose better than statements alone"
      - "Successor must find own voice for purpose, not imitate"
      - "Institutionalized purpose survives personnel changes"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Purpose statement is generic and meaningless"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Push for specificity: "Could a competitor claim this?" If yes, not specific 
        enough. Test with "trade-off test": does this help decide between real 
        alternatives? Generic purpose ("make the world better") provides no guidance.
        
    - risk: "Leadership can't agree on purpose"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Find shared experiences, not shared words. Often disagreement is about 
        language, not substance. Use reflection questions to surface underlying 
        beliefs. If genuinely misaligned, that's a larger problem to address.
        
    - risk: "Purpose is created but not communicated"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Purpose must be repeated constantly - more than feels necessary. Onboarding, 
        all-hands, performance reviews, hiring. Leaders should reference purpose 
        in decisions publicly: "We're doing X because of our purpose."
        
    - risk: "Purpose doesn't match strategy/product"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Strategy is HOW to advance purpose, not separate from it. If strategy 
        doesn't serve purpose, either strategy is wrong or purpose needs updating. 
        Don't let them diverge silently. Annual alignment check.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Purpose becomes empty marketing speak"
      impact: |
        Employees become cynical: "We say one thing, do another." Best people 
        leave. Purpose loses power as decision-making tool. Becomes liability 
        in recruiting when candidates see the gap.
      prevention: |
        Purpose must drive real decisions, not just appear on website. Leaders 
        must model purpose-driven behavior. Call out when decisions contradict 
        purpose. Better to have no stated purpose than an ignored one.
        
    - risk: "Purpose is tied to one person who leaves"
      impact: |
        When founder/CEO departs, purpose leaves with them. Team doesn't know 
        what to believe. Vacuum filled with cynicism or drift. Institutional 
        memory of "why" is lost.
      prevention: |
        Document purpose and the stories behind it. Spread purpose ownership 
        beyond one person. Ensure succession includes purpose handoff. Purpose 
        should be institutional, not personal.
