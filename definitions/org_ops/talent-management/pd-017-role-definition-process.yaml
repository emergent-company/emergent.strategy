definition:
  purpose: |
    Without clear role definitions, people don't know what's expected. 
    Hiring is inconsistent. Performance conversations lack grounding. 
    Role definitions create shared understanding of what each position 
    entails and what success looks like.
    
  outcome: |
    Every role has a documented description. Responsibilities are clear. 
    New hires know what they're signing up for. Managers can evaluate 
    performance against defined expectations.
