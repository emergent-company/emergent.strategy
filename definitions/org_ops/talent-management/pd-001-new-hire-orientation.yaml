# Core Definition (Tier 1 Focus)
definition:
  purpose: |
    New hires often feel overwhelmed and uncertain in their first days. Without proper 
    orientation, they may struggle to understand company culture, meet key people, or 
    find essential information - leading to slower ramp-up and early attrition. This 
    process ensures every new hire has a welcoming, consistent first-day experience 
    that sets them up for success.
    
  outcome: |
    New hire has completed all first-day essentials: met their team, understands their 
    role and first-week priorities, has access to core systems, and knows who to ask 
    for help. They feel welcomed and confident about their first week.

# OrgOps-Specific Context
operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - Offer signed and start date confirmed
    - Manager availability on start date
    - IT provisioning request submitted (ideally 3+ days before)
    - Workspace prepared (desk, equipment, or remote setup shipped)
    
  common_blockers:
    - "IT access delays → Submit requests 5 days before start, have backup plan"
    - "Manager unavailable → Assign deputy or reschedule to when manager available"
    - "Remote timezone challenges → Adjust schedule or record key sessions"
    - "Overwhelming information → Focus on essentials day 1, spread rest across week"

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "First engineering hire in a 4-person startup"
    practitioner: "CEO/Founder"
    organization_context: "4-person pre-seed startup, fully remote, no HR function"
    situation: |
      Maria just hired their first engineer, Alex, who starts Monday. There's no HR, 
      no onboarding checklist, and everyone is heads-down on an investor demo. The 
      CEO realizes Friday afternoon they haven't prepared anything for Alex's first day.
    trigger: "Friday 4pm realization that new hire starts Monday"
    actions: |
      1. Maria spends 30 minutes Saturday creating a simple Google Doc checklist: welcome → tools → 
         intro calls → first task. She adds links to Notion wiki, Slack invite, and GitHub.
      2. Sunday evening, sends Alex a personal welcome email with checklist and "excited to 
         have you, we'll keep it simple day 1."
      3. Monday 9am: 30-min video call to walk through the checklist together, answer questions.
      4. Maria schedules 4 x 30-min 1:1s with each team member across the week.
      5. Assigns a small "first PR" task that touches the codebase but isn't critical path.
      6. End of day 1: 15-min check-in asking "what's confusing? what do you need?"
    outcome: |
      Alex had a productive first day despite minimal preparation. The checklist became the 
      template for future hires. Key learning: sending the checklist ahead reduced day-1 anxiety.
    lessons:
      - "A simple checklist beats no process - can be created in 30 minutes"
      - "Sending materials before day 1 reduces new hire stress significantly"
      - "Small first task builds confidence faster than observation"
      - "End-of-day check-in catches problems before they compound"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Scaling onboarding from 2 to 8 hires per month"
    practitioner: "Head of People Operations"
    organization_context: "45-person Series A startup, 3 offices + remote, growing rapidly"
    situation: |
      Six months ago, Jamie (People Ops) personally onboarded every new hire with white-glove 
      service. Now they're hiring 8 people per month and Jamie is spending 50% of time on 
      onboarding. Quality is dropping - last week a new hire didn't get laptop access for 3 days.
    trigger: "Third complaint this month about onboarding issues; CEO asks what's happening"
    actions: |
      1. Jamie maps current process, finds 23 manual steps per hire, 6 require their personal involvement.
      2. Creates Notion onboarding hub with: welcome video, company overview, team pages, tool guides.
      3. Builds automated workflow in HRIS: 7 days before start → trigger IT provisioning, 
         manager reminder, buddy assignment.
      4. Introduces "onboarding buddy" role: peer who handles day-1 logistics, answers questions.
      5. Creates cohort onboarding: bi-weekly "Welcome to Company" session for all new hires 
         (replaces 1:1 culture explanation).
      6. Implements 2-week survey with 5 questions to catch issues early.
    outcome: |
      Jamie's involvement dropped from 4 hours to 30 minutes per hire. Laptop/access issues 
      eliminated through automation. New hire satisfaction actually improved (4.2 → 4.5/5) 
      because buddies provided more accessible support than busy People Ops.
    lessons:
      - "Automation enables scale but buddy system maintains human touch"
      - "Cohort sessions are more efficient AND create new hire community"
      - "The 2-week survey catches issues before they become attrition"
      - "Manager involvement can't be automated - schedule their time explicitly"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Remote-first onboarding across 8 timezones"
    practitioner: "Office Manager / Remote Experience Lead"
    organization_context: "70-person fully remote company, team distributed globally, async-first culture"
    situation: |
      New customer success hire in Singapore, manager in NYC, team spread across APAC and 
      Americas. Live overlap is only 2 hours. Previous remote onboardings felt disconnected - 
      one new hire said "I didn't feel like part of the team until month 3."
    trigger: "New APAC hire starting next week, CEO wants better remote onboarding experience"
    actions: |
      1. Ships welcome box 2 weeks early: laptop, swag, handwritten note from manager, snack box.
      2. Creates async onboarding: Loom videos from CEO (culture), manager (role), each teammate 
         (personal intro + "here's what I work on").
      3. Schedules the 2-hour overlap for high-value sync: 1:1 with manager + meet-the-team call.
      4. Assigns APAC buddy in similar timezone for daily async check-ins first 2 weeks.
      5. Creates "First Week Quest": gamified checklist with small tasks + reward (shipped snack box).
      6. Manager commits to async Loom response within 24 hours for questions.
    outcome: |
      New hire reported feeling "surprisingly connected" despite timezone challenges. The 
      async video intros were rewatchable (new hire watched manager intro 3 times). Buddy in 
      timezone handled the "stupid questions" that new hires feel awkward asking manager.
    lessons:
      - "Physical welcome box compensates for lack of in-person warmth"
      - "Async video intros are better than live for timezone-distributed teams"
      - "Same-timezone buddy is essential - not optional - for remote hires"
      - "Gamification of checklist increased completion rate from 60% to 95%"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "IT access not ready on day 1 - new hire can't work"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Submit IT provisioning request 5+ business days before start. Create "day 1 backup kit": 
        guest wifi, temporary logins, offline reading materials. Have IT on standby day 1 morning.
        
    - risk: "Manager double-booked or unavailable on start date"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Block manager calendar 2 weeks ahead. Require deputy designation. If truly unavailable, 
        reschedule start date - a manager-less first day signals "you don't matter."
        
    - risk: "Information overload - new hire overwhelmed and retains nothing"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Limit day 1 to essentials: team, tools, first task. Spread content across week 1. 
        Provide written reference (wiki, doc) so new hire isn't memorizing. Check in end of day.
        
    - risk: "New hire feels isolated (especially remote)"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Assign buddy who checks in daily. Schedule social touchpoints (virtual coffee). 
        For remote: ship welcome box, use video for meetings, introduce in team chat.
        
    - risk: "No clear first task - new hire doesn't know what to do"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Manager prepares specific first task before day 1. Task should be achievable in 1-2 days, 
        provide quick win, and touch real work. "Read the docs" is not a task.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Poor onboarding leads to early attrition (quit within 90 days)"
      impact: |
        Losing a hire within 90 days costs 1.5-3x annual salary in recruiting, lost 
        productivity, team disruption, and knowledge loss. Early attrition is often 
        cited as "culture fit" but frequently traces back to onboarding failures.
      prevention: |
        Systematic orientation with clear expectations, buddy system, 2-week check-in survey. 
        Track early attrition and conduct exit interviews to identify onboarding gaps.
        
    - risk: "Inconsistent onboarding creates unequal employee experience"
      impact: |
        When onboarding quality depends on which manager or which office, employees compare 
        notes. This breeds resentment ("my friend got 2 weeks of training, I got a Slack message") 
        and can surface as retention or DEI issues.
      prevention: |
        Standardized checklist and core content that all managers follow. Central People Ops 
        oversight. Regular manager training on onboarding responsibilities.
        
    - risk: "Compliance failures: missing documentation, incomplete training"
      impact: |
        Audit findings, legal exposure, regulatory penalties. In some jurisdictions, failure 
        to complete required training (harassment, safety) within mandated timeframe is violation.
      prevention: |
        Automated checklist tracking with compliance items marked as mandatory. Don't close 
        onboarding until all required items complete. Regular audit of completion records.

# Domain Context - Industry Best Practices and Benchmarks
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Onboarding has evolved significantly from "HR paperwork day" to a strategic investment in 
    employee success. Research shows strong onboarding improves retention by 82% (Brandon Hall) 
    and productivity by 70%. Yet 88% of organizations don't onboard well (Gallup). The shift to 
    remote/hybrid has forced companies to rethink onboarding entirely - physical office tours 
    and lunch introductions are no longer default options.
    
    Leading companies now view onboarding as extending through the first 90 days, not just 
    day 1. "Preboarding" (engagement between offer acceptance and start date) is emerging as 
    a differentiator. There's also growing recognition that manager involvement - not just 
    HR execution - is the primary driver of onboarding success.

  best_practices:
    - "Send preboarding materials 1-2 weeks before start (reduces first-day anxiety, builds excitement)"
    - "Assign an onboarding buddy separate from manager (safe space for 'stupid questions')"
    - "Limit day 1 to essentials: people, tools, first task. Spread content across week 1"
    - "Provide a 'quick win' first task - achievable in 1-2 days, builds confidence"
    - "Schedule regular check-ins: day 1, week 1, week 2, day 30, day 60, day 90"
    - "Use cohort onboarding at scale - builds peer community, more efficient"
    - "Create written reference materials (wiki) - don't rely on new hire memory"
    - "For remote: invest in physical welcome experience (shipped box, handwritten note)"
    
  anti_patterns:
    - "Drinking from the firehose: 8 hours of presentations on day 1 (retention near zero)"
    - "Manager MIA: delegating entire onboarding to HR or buddy (signals low priority)"
    - "No first task: new hire spends week 1 'reading docs' with no direction"
    - "Inconsistent experience: onboarding quality depends on luck of manager/team"
    - "Compliance-only: treating onboarding as paperwork exercise, not cultural immersion"
    - "Sink or swim: assuming smart people will 'figure it out' (wastes talent, causes attrition)"
    - "Ignoring remote differences: running same program for office and remote hires"
