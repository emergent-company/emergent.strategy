definition:
  purpose: |
    Employees need time off for rest, personal needs, and life events. 
    Without a clear policy, requests are inconsistent, coverage is 
    problematic, and people may not take enough time off. A good policy 
    balances flexibility with business needs.
    
  outcome: |
    Employees know their PTO entitlement. Request process is clear. 
    Time off is tracked accurately. Business has visibility for 
    coverage planning. Employees take adequate rest.

# Unlimited PTO Best Practices
unlimited_pto:
  making_it_work:
    - "Set minimum expectations (e.g., 'we expect you to take at least 3 weeks')"
    - "Leaders model taking time off"
    - "Track usage even if unlimited"
    - "Discuss in 1:1s if someone isn't taking time"
    - "Don't penalize for taking time"
    
  common_pitfalls:
    - "People take less than traditional PTO"
    - "Guilt about taking time"
    - "No payout liability (could be seen negatively)"
    - "Harder to ensure coverage without tracking"
