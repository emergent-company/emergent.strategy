definition:
  purpose: |
    People leave for many reasons. Without proper offboarding, knowledge 
    walks out the door, security risks remain (active accounts), and 
    departures feel abrupt. Good offboarding protects the company and 
    maintains relationships.
    
  outcome: |
    All access is promptly revoked. Equipment is returned. Knowledge is 
    transferred. Final pay and benefits are processed correctly. The 
    departure is handled professionally.

# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-016-001
    name: "Senior Engineer Departure with Critical Knowledge"
    practitioner: CTO at 45-person B2B SaaS
    organization_context: |
      Series A startup with 12 engineers. One of the original team members 
      who designed core authentication system is leaving for a competitor. 
      She's the only person who deeply understands the legacy auth code.
    situation: |
      Sarah gave standard 2-week notice. She's been professional but firm 
      about her departure date. The auth system has been stable but undocumented. 
      Two critical features shipping next quarter depend on auth modifications. 
      Team is anxious about losing her knowledge.
    trigger: |
      Sarah submitted resignation on Monday. HR sent standard offboarding checklist.
      CTO realizes the checklist doesn't address the massive knowledge gap about to walk out.
    actions:
      - "Day 1: Had honest conversation with Sarah about transition timeline—she agreed to extend to 3 weeks for proper handover"
      - "Day 1-2: Identified the 5 most critical knowledge areas (auth flows, API integrations, deployment quirks, monitoring alerts, disaster recovery)"
      - "Day 3-8: Scheduled intensive pair-programming sessions where Sarah walked through each system with her designated successor"
      - "Day 5-10: Had Sarah create video walkthroughs of complex debugging scenarios she's handled"
      - "Day 10-15: Sarah reviewed and approved documentation written by her successor to validate accuracy"
      - "Day 14: Conducted warm handoffs with external vendors who only knew Sarah as the contact"
      - "Day 15: Final day—exit interview, equipment return, all access revoked, but kept her on alumni Slack for 30-day questions"
    outcome: |
      Knowledge transfer was imperfect but sufficient. Successor had rough first month 
      but could handle all critical issues. Documentation created during handoff became 
      permanent team asset. One auth bug that would have taken weeks to debug was 
      solved in 2 hours thanks to video walkthrough. Sarah appreciated the professional 
      departure and became a reference source for recruiting.
    lessons:
      - "Standard 2-week notice is rarely enough for specialized knowledge holders—negotiate transition time"
      - "Video walkthroughs capture context that written docs miss (why decisions were made, what failed before)"
      - "Identify knowledge-critical employees BEFORE they resign and create succession documentation proactively"
      - "Alumni relationship can continue to provide value if departure is handled well"

    name: "Unexpected Termination with Security Concerns"
    practitioner: VP of Operations at 80-person fintech
    organization_context: |
      Series B company handling sensitive financial data. An employee in the 
      data engineering team was discovered accessing customer records outside 
      their job requirements. Investigation confirmed policy violation. 
      Termination decision made. Employee has admin access to production databases.
    situation: |
      Friday 4pm decision made to terminate Monday morning. Weekend to plan. 
      Employee is technically sophisticated and unhappy about recent performance 
      feedback. High risk of data exfiltration or sabotage if termination is 
      handled poorly. Legal has cleared the termination for cause.
    trigger: |
      HR director called emergency meeting with IT, Legal, and employee's manager.
      Standard offboarding checklist completely inadequate for this scenario.
    actions:
      - "Friday 6pm: IT disabled all production database write access, preserved read access to avoid alerting"
      - "Friday 8pm: Created audit trail of all employee access for past 90 days for legal review"
      - "Saturday: IT prepared complete access revocation script—all 47 systems—to execute instantly"
      - "Sunday: Legal prepared separation agreement and coached manager on termination conversation"
      - "Monday 9am: Manager and HR met with employee in conference room near exit"
      - "Monday 9:05am: IT executed access revocation script the moment termination was communicated"
      - "Monday 9:15am: Employee was walked to desk, personal items collected under observation"
      - "Monday 9:30am: Employee exited building, badge deactivated, laptop collected"
      - "Monday 10am: Team communication sent explaining transition (no details on termination reason)"
    outcome: |
      Clean termination with no security incidents. Audit trail showed no data 
      exfiltration in final weeks. Employee signed separation agreement. 
      Production systems unaffected. Team was unsettled for a week but respected 
      the professional handling. Learned that instant access revocation capability 
      is critical—now maintained for all employees.
    lessons:
      - "High-risk terminations require coordinated planning between IT, Legal, HR, and management"
      - "Access revocation must be INSTANT when termination is communicated—have scripts ready"
      - "Audit trails are essential—know exactly what employee accessed leading up to departure"
      - "Team communication matters—acknowledge the departure, explain transition, don't create rumors"
      - "Weekend planning time is valuable for complex terminations"

  - id: ps-016-003
    name: "Departing Manager with Team Transition"
    practitioner: COO at 120-person e-commerce company
    organization_context: |
      Head of Customer Success managing 15 people is leaving after 4 years. 
      Great performer, no drama, but her departure creates leadership vacuum. 
      Two senior team members are potential successors but neither is clearly 
      ready. Team morale is fragile after recent company pivot.
    situation: |
      Lisa gave 4 weeks notice—generous but still challenging. Her team handles 
      $2M/month in customer renewals. Q4 renewal season starting in 6 weeks. 
      No clear succession plan. Two internal candidates (Marcus and Priya) both 
      want the role but have different strengths. External hiring would take 
      3+ months.
    trigger: |
      Lisa's resignation triggered urgent succession planning that should have 
      happened 2 years ago. Standard offboarding checklist doesn't address 
      leadership transition or team psychology.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: COO had candid conversations with Marcus and Priya about interim plans, not promising permanent role yet"
      - "Week 1: Lisa identified her key relationships—3 enterprise accounts, 2 key partners, executive sponsors"
      - "Week 1-2: Lisa and COO co-led warm handoffs for all key relationships to appropriate team members"
      - "Week 2: Announced interim structure—Marcus would lead renewals (his strength), Priya would lead expansion (her strength)"
      - "Week 2-3: Lisa documented her operating rhythms, decision frameworks, and escalation patterns"
      - "Week 3: Lisa led team meeting to introduce interim structure, answer questions, express confidence in team"
      - "Week 3-4: Lisa shadowed by Marcus and Priya in all leadership meetings to transfer context"
      - "Week 4: Exit interview focused on organizational feedback, team dynamics, succession recommendations"
      - "Week 4: Final day—team farewell lunch, Lisa remained accessible via email for 60 days for questions"
    outcome: |
      Interim structure worked better than expected. Marcus and Priya's combined 
      leadership covered Lisa's capabilities. Q4 renewals exceeded target by 8%. 
      After 3 months, promoted Marcus to Head of CS with Priya as Senior Manager. 
      Lisa's documented frameworks became team playbook. Learned that succession 
      planning is ongoing work, not departure-triggered emergency.
    lessons:
      - "Manager departures require leadership transition plan, not just task handoff"
      - "Interim structures can be creative—splitting the role initially is valid"
      - "Document management frameworks and decision patterns, not just tasks"
      - "Extended accessibility post-departure is valuable for leadership transitions"
      - "Team morale requires transparent communication about uncertainty and plans"

# RISKS
# ============================================================
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: Access not fully revoked
      likelihood: medium
      impact: critical
      mitigation: "Maintain complete access inventory (SSO + manual list), use automated revocation scripts, verify revocation with access audit 24 hours post-departure"
    
    - risk: Critical knowledge lost
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Identify knowledge-critical employees proactively, require documentation as part of ongoing work, structure handoff time proportional to knowledge concentration"
    
    - risk: Equipment not returned
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Track all equipment in asset management, include equipment return in final pay processing, have clear remote return procedures with prepaid shipping"
    
    - risk: Final pay processed incorrectly
      likelihood: low
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Use HRIS with offboarding workflow automation, verify final calculations with finance, know jurisdiction-specific timing requirements"
    
    - risk: Legal compliance failure
      likelihood: low
      impact: critical
      mitigation: "Document state/country-specific requirements, use legal review for involuntary terminations, have standard separation agreement template reviewed by counsel"
    
    - risk: Poor communication causing rumors
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Prepare team communication in advance, be transparent about transition (not termination reasons), address questions promptly"

  organizational_risks:
    - risk: Departures cluster after visible exit
      impact: "One departure signals others to consider options; can trigger wave of resignations especially if popular employee leaves"
      prevention: "Exit interviews to identify systemic issues, quick follow-up 1:1s with team members, address any concerns raised, ensure remaining team feels valued"
    
    - risk: Customer relationships lost with employee
      impact: "Key accounts may follow trusted contact to new company; relationships not transferred leave revenue at risk"
      prevention: "Structured relationship handoffs well before last day, introduce successors to all key stakeholders, document relationship history and context"
    
    - risk: Institutional knowledge permanently lost
      impact: "Historical context, tribal knowledge, and 'why we do it this way' explanations disappear; team repeats past mistakes"
      prevention: "Ongoing documentation culture (not departure-triggered), video recordings of key processes, knowledge captured in systems not just heads"

# ============================================================
# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Offboarding has evolved from administrative compliance to strategic people 
    operation. The "boomerang" trend (employees returning after external stints) 
    has made departure experience as important as hiring experience. Companies 
    like Microsoft, LinkedIn, and Bain have formal alumni programs recognizing 
    that today's leaver may be tomorrow's customer, partner, or returning employee.
    
    Remote work has complicated equipment recovery and made access revocation 
    more critical (no physical building access to rely on). SSO and identity 
    management platforms (Okta, Azure AD) enable instant, comprehensive access 
    revocation that was impossible with manual processes.
    
    Exit interview analytics have matured—companies now correlate departure 
    reasons with engagement data to predict and prevent unwanted attrition. 
    The shift from "processing departures" to "learning from departures" 
    reflects talent scarcity and the high cost of replacement.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Maintain real-time access inventory"
      description: "Know exactly what each employee can access—updated continuously, not departure-triggered"
      evidence: "Companies with SSO and identity management have 90%+ faster access revocation"
    
    - practice: "Proportional knowledge transfer"
      description: "Scale handoff time to knowledge concentration—longer for specialists, key relationship holders, system owners"
      evidence: "Standard 2-week notice is insufficient for specialized roles; 3-4 weeks or structured handover reduces knowledge loss"
    
    - practice: "Alumni programs"
      description: "Maintain connections with departed employees through alumni networks, newsletters, events"
      evidence: "McKinsey, Bain, and LinkedIn attribute significant referrals, boomerang hires, and business development to alumni programs"
    
    - practice: "Exit interview as data source"
      description: "Aggregate and analyze exit interview data to identify systemic issues, not just individual departures"
      evidence: "Companies analyzing exit data report 15-20% reduction in preventable attrition"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Burning bridges"
      description: "Treating departing employees as traitors, restricting information, making departure difficult"
      consequence: "Negative Glassdoor reviews, lost referrals, damaged employer brand, boomerang hires blocked"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Checklist-only offboarding"
      description: "Treating offboarding as purely administrative, missing knowledge transfer and relationship handoff"
      consequence: "Critical information walks out the door, relationships lost, team scrambles to fill gaps"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Delayed access revocation"
      description: "Not revoking access immediately upon departure, leaving 'just in case' access active"
      consequence: "Security vulnerabilities, compliance violations, potential for data exfiltration (even accidental)"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Ignoring departure patterns"
      description: "Treating each departure as isolated event, not analyzing trends or clusters"
      consequence: "Systemic issues persist, preventable attrition continues, costly patterns not addressed"
