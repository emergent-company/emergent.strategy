definition:
  purpose: |
    People have blind spots about their own behavior and impact. Single-source 
    feedback (just from manager) misses important perspectives. 360 feedback 
    provides a more complete picture for development planning.
    
  outcome: |
    Each participant receives aggregated, anonymous feedback from multiple 
    perspectives. Clear strengths and development areas are identified. 
    Input feeds into development planning and career conversations.
