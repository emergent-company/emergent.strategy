definition:
  purpose: |
    Compensation must be fair and competitive to retain talent. Without 
    regular review, pay drifts out of market, creates internal inequity, 
    and leads to attrition. A compensation review process ensures 
    alignment with market and performance.
    
  outcome: |
    Compensation is reviewed regularly. Pay is competitive with market. 
    High performers are rewarded. Internal equity is maintained. 
    Budget is allocated strategically.

# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-032-001
    name: "First Compensation Band Creation from Scratch"
    practitioner: VP of People at 55-person startup
    organization_context: |
      Series A startup that grew from 15 to 55 people in 18 months. Compensation 
      has been ad-hoc—every offer negotiated individually. Massive internal 
      inequities discovered: same-level engineers with 40% salary differences. 
      Board pushing for compensation structure. No dedicated comp person.
    situation: |
      CEO committed to board that compensation bands would be in place by Q3. 
      VP of People has 8 weeks. Three engineers threatening to leave over pay 
      inequity (they talk to each other). Need to create fair structure without 
      massive budget for market adjustments.
    trigger: |
      Senior engineer discovered junior colleague making more than her. 
      Asked CEO directly. CEO promised "we're building a fair compensation system."
    actions:
      - "Week 1-2: Collected all current compensation data, mapped employees to preliminary levels (Junior/Mid/Senior/Lead)"
      - "Week 2: Subscribed to Pave for market data, pulled benchmarks for all roles"
      - "Week 3: Analyzed gaps—12 employees significantly below market, 3 above market, 40 roughly aligned"
      - "Week 3: Designed simple bands with 15% ranges per level, positioned at 50th percentile for base"
      - "Week 4: Worked with CFO on budget for market adjustments—secured $180K for immediate corrections"
      - "Week 5: Calibration with managers—leveled every employee against new framework"
      - "Week 6: Created 3 tiers: immediate adjustment (>15% below market), next cycle (5-15% below), at market"
      - "Week 7: Communicated framework to all employees, shared bands publicly within company"
      - "Week 8: Managers had 1:1s explaining individual position, path forward, and any adjustments"
    outcome: |
      Framework launched on time. 8 employees received immediate raises (avg 12%). 
      15 flagged for priority in next review cycle. The 3 retention risks stayed 
      after understanding their path forward. Some managers struggled to explain 
      "why no raise now" but having clear criteria made it defensible. 
      Framework became foundation for all future offers and promotions.
    lessons:
      - "Starting from scratch requires accepting imperfection—iterate annually"
      - "Transparency about framework (even with gaps) builds more trust than secrecy"
      - "Budget for immediate corrections is essential—can't fix equity over time only"
      - "Managers need talking points for difficult conversations, not just numbers"
      - "Internal equity matters as much as external market position"

    name: "Retention Crisis During Market Boom"
    practitioner: CHRO at 200-person fintech
    organization_context: |
      Series C fintech with engineering team of 80. Suddenly in 6 weeks lost 
      5 senior engineers to FAANG and well-funded competitors offering 50-80% 
      increases. Remaining team nervous. Compensation was at 50th percentile 
      by design. Market for fintech engineers spiked dramatically.
    situation: |
      Board meeting in 3 weeks. Engineering velocity has dropped due to departures. 
      Recruiting pipeline is dry—can't compete on cash. CEO asking for 
      "retention plan" but budget is constrained (18 months runway). 
      Need creative solution that doesn't bankrupt the company.
    trigger: |
      5th engineer resignation in 6 weeks. Exit interview revealed offer was 
      70% above current pay. CTO escalated to CEO: "We're going to lose the team."
    actions:
      - "Day 1-3: Emergency market analysis—found fintech engineer comp had jumped 35% in 6 months"
      - "Day 4-5: Identified 25 'critical retention risks'—engineers with specialized skills or key projects"
      - "Day 5-7: Designed tiered retention approach—cash + equity + non-monetary"
      - "Day 8-10: Negotiated with board for $1.2M retention budget (mixture of cash increases and equity acceleration)"
      - "Day 10-12: Created 'critical talent' retention packages—15-25% base increases + one-time equity refresh"
      - "Day 12-14: Rolled out remote work flexibility (was hybrid-required), compressed workweeks pilot"
      - "Day 15-18: CTO + CHRO personally met with each of 25 critical engineers—retention conversations"
      - "Day 19-21: Announced revised compensation philosophy—moved from 50th to 65th percentile target"
      - "Week 4: Board update with full plan and 6-month monitoring commitment"
    outcome: |
      Lost 2 more engineers during response period but stabilized after. 
      22 of 25 critical engineers stayed. Equity refresh was most valued 
      component. Remote flexibility helped more than expected. Recruiting 
      improved with new comp positioning. Burned through retention budget 
      but avoided catastrophic team collapse. Learned that comp philosophy 
      must flex with market, not stay static.
    lessons:
      - "Market comp can move faster than annual review cycles—need monitoring mechanisms"
      - "Retention packages must be holistic—cash alone often isn't enough"
      - "Tiered approach (critical vs. all employees) is necessary when budget is limited"
      - "Personal conversations from leaders matter—not just HR announcements"
      - "Waiting for attrition to act is expensive—proactive market monitoring is cheaper"

    name: "Pay Transparency Implementation"
    practitioner: Head of People at 90-person edtech
    organization_context: |
      Series B company in Colorado (state with emerging pay transparency laws). 
      Leadership committed to full pay transparency before legal requirement. 
      Current state: bands exist but not shared, wide variation within bands, 
      some salaries would be controversial if disclosed.
    situation: |
      CEO wants to announce pay transparency in 6 months as competitive advantage 
      for recruiting. But current data shows problems: 8 employees above band maximums, 
      12 significantly below band minimums, gender pay gap exists in 2 departments. 
      Can't just publish current bands without addressing issues.
    trigger: |
      CEO read about transparency trend, competitor announced it, California 
      law passed. Decision: "Let's lead on this before it's mandated."
    actions:
      - "Month 1: Complete compensation audit—mapped every employee to role, level, band position, demographic data"
      - "Month 1: Identified all exceptions—8 above-band (legacy or negotiated), 12 below-band (under-leveled or underpaid)"
      - "Month 2: Redesigned bands with wider ranges (20% vs 15%) to accommodate variation, re-benchmarked to market"
      - "Month 2: Analyzed pay gaps—found 4% gender gap in engineering, 6% gap in sales (both explainable by tenure, but optics bad)"
      - "Month 3: Worked with finance on $250K budget for equity adjustments over 2 quarters"
      - "Month 3: Created adjustment plan—phase 1: below-band employees to band minimum, phase 2: address demographic gaps"
      - "Month 4: Above-band employees frozen (no increases until band catches up), communicated individually"
      - "Month 4: Manager training—how to discuss pay, bands, career progression in transparent environment"
      - "Month 5: Soft launch—bands shared with managers, Q&A sessions, feedback collection"
      - "Month 6: Full launch—bands published on internal wiki, announced in all-hands, included in recruiting"
    outcome: |
      Transparency launched on schedule. Some discomfort initially—people 
      comparing themselves to peers. But conversations shifted to "how do I 
      grow to next band" rather than "am I paid fairly." Recruiting improved 
      measurably—candidates appreciated clarity. Minor regretted attrition 
      from above-band employees who didn't accept freeze. Gender gap closed 
      by Month 8. Recognized by industry publication for progressive approach.
    lessons:
      - "Transparency requires prep work—can't just publish broken data"
      - "Addressing gaps before transparency is essential—fixes after are harder politically"
      - "Above-band employees need careful handling—freezing feels like punishment"
      - "Manager training is critical—they're the ones having the conversations"
      - "Transparency changes compensation culture fundamentally—more focus on leveling and career growth"

# RISKS
# ============================================================
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: Budget insufficient for needed adjustments
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Prioritize adjustments (retention risks first), spread over multiple cycles, communicate honestly about constraints and timeline"
    
    - risk: Manager recommendations inconsistent
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Calibration sessions with cross-manager visibility, clear guidelines with examples, review distribution across teams"
    
    - risk: Market data outdated or inappropriate
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Use multiple data sources, validate with recent hires/offers, consider industry-specific benchmarks not just general tech"
    
    - risk: Communication handled poorly
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Manager training on comp conversations, scripted talking points for difficult scenarios, escalation path for questions"
    
    - risk: Timeline slips causing frustration
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Set realistic timeline with buffer, communicate expected dates early, stick to commitments"
    
    - risk: Equity/bonus forgotten in cash focus
      likelihood: low
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Design total comp approach including base, equity, bonus; don't treat in isolation"

  organizational_risks:
    - risk: Internal inequity creates resentment
      impact: "Employees who learn they're paid less than peers feel undervalued; can trigger attrition or disengagement even if absolute pay is fair"
      prevention: "Proactive internal equity analysis, clear leveling criteria, structured process reduces 'negotiation premium' for new hires"
    
    - risk: Compensation arms race with competitors
      impact: "Matching every outside offer creates unsustainable cost structure; signals that threatening to leave is how to get raised"
      prevention: "Clear philosophy on market positioning, don't match offers as policy, provide growth path instead of reactive retention"
    
    - risk: Pay transparency done poorly damages trust
      impact: "Publishing bands without addressing underlying problems exposes inequities; employees feel deceived rather than informed"
      prevention: "Clean up data before transparency, address gaps proactively, be ready to explain any remaining variation"

# ============================================================
# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Compensation management has transformed from annual HR ritual to competitive 
    weapon. Real-time compensation data (Levels.fyi, Glassdoor, Blind) means 
    employees know market rates instantly. Pay transparency laws (California, 
    Colorado, New York) are forcing disclosure. Companies that lag on comp 
    lose talent before they realize there's a problem.
    
    The equity component has become increasingly important for tech companies. 
    Carta, Pulley, and similar platforms have made equity administration 
    easier. Employees are more sophisticated about equity value—demanding 
    refresh grants, understanding dilution, comparing equity packages.
    
    Total rewards thinking has expanded beyond cash + equity to include 
    flexibility, development, culture, and purpose. Companies compete on 
    the full package, not just compensation. But cash and equity remain 
    table stakes—you can't flexibility your way out of below-market pay.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Continuous market monitoring"
      description: "Track market movement quarterly, not just during annual review"
      evidence: "Companies with continuous monitoring report faster response to market shifts and 15-20% lower regretted attrition"
    
    - practice: "Pay for performance differentiation"
      description: "Top performers receive meaningfully larger increases than average performers"
      evidence: "Research shows 3-5x differentiation in increase budget between top and bottom performers retains high performers"
    
    - practice: "Internal equity analysis"
      description: "Regularly analyze pay by demographics, tenure, hire date to identify systemic gaps"
      evidence: "Proactive equity analysis reduces legal risk and addresses problems before they become retention issues"
    
    - practice: "Manager calibration"
      description: "Cross-functional review of recommendations to ensure consistency and address bias"
      evidence: "Calibration reduces manager bias by 20-30% and improves perceived fairness"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Cost-of-living-only increases"
      description: "Giving everyone 3% regardless of performance, market movement, or leveling"
      consequence: "High performers feel unrewarded, fall behind market, leave; low performers get free ride"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Negotiation-based comp"
      description: "Salary determined primarily by negotiation skill, creating inequity from day one"
      consequence: "Systematic disadvantage for underrepresented groups, internal inequity, culture of mistrust"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Secrecy as strategy"
      description: "Relying on employees not knowing what others make or what market pays"
      consequence: "Backfires in transparent market; employees discover gaps and feel deceived"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Reactive retention"
      description: "Only giving raises when employees have outside offers"
      consequence: "Rewards disloyal behavior, penalizes committed employees, creates bidding culture"

  benchmarks:
    - metric: "Compensation cycle completion"
      top_quartile: "100% of employees reviewed within 2 weeks of target date"
      median: "80-90% within 4 weeks"

    - metric: "Internal equity gap"
      top_quartile: "<3% unexplained gap by demographic group"
      median: "5-8% gap with partial explanation"
      laggard: ">10% gap or not measured"
    
    - metric: "Market position"
      top_quartile: "Clear philosophy (e.g., 65th percentile), monitored quarterly"
      median: "Annual benchmark, roughly 50th percentile target"
      laggard: "No market data, comp based on 'feel' or negotiation"
    
    - metric: "Manager calibration participation"
      top_quartile: "100% of managers, cross-functional sessions, documented decisions"
      median: "Most managers, within-function only"
      laggard: "No calibration, individual manager discretion"
