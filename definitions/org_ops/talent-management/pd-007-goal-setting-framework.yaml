definition:
  purpose: |
    Without explicit goals, work becomes reactive and fragmented. Team members 
    may work hard but not on the right things. Goal setting creates focus, 
    enables prioritization, and provides basis for measuring success.
    
  outcome: |
    Each team member has clear, written goals aligned with team/company 
    priorities. Progress is trackable. Manager and employee share understanding 
    of success criteria.

# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-007-001
    name: "OKR Implementation After Rapid Team Growth"
    practitioner: VP of Product at 65-person startup
    organization_context: |
      Series B company that grew from 25 to 65 in 12 months. Product team went 
      from 5 to 18. Previously everyone knew what mattered—proximity handled 
      alignment. Now teams are working on conflicting priorities, launching 
      features that don't connect to strategy, and friction between teams is 
      increasing. CEO says "we need OKRs."
    situation: |
      End of Q3, planning for Q4. Product teams have no formal goal system. 
      Each PM has their own roadmap, loosely connected to company direction. 
      Last quarter, two teams built overlapping features. Engineering complains 
      they don't know what's most important. CEO wants OKRs implemented for Q4.
    trigger: |
      CEO in weekly leadership meeting: "Why are we building feature X when 
      our biggest problem is retention? We need OKRs to create alignment."
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Read 'Measure What Matters' over weekend, attended OKR workshop at local startup community"
      - "Week 1: Met with 5 PMs to understand current goal-setting practices (found: mostly none)"
      - "Week 2: Drafted company OKRs with CEO—3 Objectives, 3 Key Results each, focused on Q4 priorities"
      - "Week 2: Presented draft company OKRs at all-hands, collected feedback"
      - "Week 3: Each team drafted their OKRs—cascaded from company level but with team ownership"
      - "Week 3: OKR calibration sessions—teams presented to each other, identified conflicts and dependencies"
      - "Week 4: Published final OKRs on Notion wiki, visible to entire company"
      - "Mid-Q4: Weekly OKR check-ins in team meetings, monthly company-level review"
      - "End Q4: Retrospective on OKR process—what worked, what to improve for Q1"
    outcome: |
      Messy first quarter but achieved alignment. Teams finally saw how their work 
      connected to company priorities. Two planned features deprioritized when OKR 
      conflicts surfaced. Engineering loved the clarity—knew what mattered. About 
      60% of key results achieved (right for first quarter with stretch goals). 
      Process improved significantly in Q1. Some teams over-indexed on metrics 
      vs outcomes initially.
    lessons:
      - "First OKR quarter is about learning the practice, not perfection"
      - "Visibility is the main benefit—everyone seeing what matters"
      - "Cross-team calibration surfaces conflicts before they become problems"
      - "Key results should be outcomes, not outputs—easy to get wrong initially"
      - "OKRs work better when company level is stable; team level can adjust quarterly"

  - id: ps-007-002
    name: "Goal Fatigue Reset in Established Company"
    practitioner: Chief People Officer at 300-person SaaS company
    organization_context: |
      Series C company with 5 years of OKR history. Started well but decayed. 
      Current state: 15 company objectives (too many), teams set 8-10 OKRs each 
      (too many), quarterly process takes 6 weeks (too long), mid-quarter reviews 
      stopped happening, end-of-quarter scores are theater. Team says "OKRs are 
      busywork."
    situation: |
      Q4 planning approaching. CPO surveyed employees—68% say OKRs don't help 
      them prioritize, 72% say the process takes too long, 45% couldn't name 
      a company OKR. Leadership wants to "fix" OKRs rather than abandon them. 
      Risk: another overcomplicated fix that makes it worse.
    trigger: |
      CEO asked CPO: "Everyone hates our OKR process. It's supposed to create 
      focus but we have more goals than ever. Fix it or kill it."
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Analyzed history—OKRs bloated gradually, each quarter added more 'important' objectives"
      - "Week 1: Benchmarked with 5 similar-stage companies—found they averaged 3-5 company OKRs"
      - "Week 2: Proposed radical simplification: 3 company OKRs maximum, teams get 3-5, individuals get 3"
      - "Week 2: Leadership offsite to brutally prioritize—forced ranking of 15 objectives down to 3"
      - "Week 3: Redesigned process—2 weeks max for entire company, templates simplified"
      - "Week 3: Killed mid-quarter formal reviews, replaced with weekly async updates in Slack"
      - "Week 4: Relaunched OKRs as '3-3-3' system—3 objectives max at each level"
      - "Q4: Weekly 15-minute OKR standups in team meetings (not separate meeting)"
      - "End Q4: Survey showed 72% found OKRs helpful (up from 32%), process took 8 days (down from 6 weeks)"
    outcome: |
      Reset successful. Simplification was the answer, not more process. 
      Fewer goals = more focus. Teams actually used OKRs for prioritization 
      because they could remember them. Leadership discipline was the key—
      refusing to add more objectives. Hardest part: saying no to "important" 
      things. Some leaders resisted until they saw results.
    lessons:
      - "OKR problems are usually 'too many' not 'too few'—simplify first"
      - "Process bloat happens gradually—need periodic resets"
      - "If people can't remember the goals, you have too many"
      - "Weekly async updates beat monthly formal reviews for engagement"
      - "Leadership discipline in setting company OKRs determines everything downstream"

  - id: ps-007-003
    name: "Individual Goals for Non-Traditional Roles"
    practitioner: HR Manager at 45-person creative agency
    organization_context: |
      Design and marketing agency where work is client-driven and unpredictable. 
      Tried implementing individual goals but they felt forced. Designers said 
      "I can't predict what projects I'll have next quarter." Account managers 
      said "My goals depend on what clients want." Previous attempt abandoned 
      after 2 quarters.
    situation: |
      CEO wants accountability and development conversations but standard goal 
      frameworks don't fit. Work is project-based, not roadmap-based. Excellence 
      is craft-based, not metric-based. Need goal system that works for creative 
      professionals without feeling corporate.
    trigger: |
      Annual review time—managers have no goals to evaluate against. 
      Reviews become subjective "I think you did good work" conversations. 
      High performers feel undifferentiated from average performers.
    actions:
      - "Month 1: Researched alternative frameworks—found 'Areas of Focus' model from creative industries"
      - "Month 1: Interviewed 10 team members about what 'success' meant to them personally"
      - "Month 2: Designed hybrid system: (1) Craft Goals—skills to develop, (2) Impact Goals—client/team outcomes"
      - "Month 2: Craft Goals: 1-2 skills to grow (e.g., 'animation fundamentals,' 'client presentation')"
      - "Month 2: Impact Goals: 1-2 outcomes to achieve regardless of project (e.g., 'lead a pitch,' 'mentor a junior')"
      - "Month 3: Pilot with design team—managers helped team members set 2 craft + 2 impact goals"
      - "Month 3: Quarterly check-ins focused on 'what did you learn?' not 'did you hit the number?'"
      - "Month 4: Expanded to full agency after design team validation"
      - "Month 6: First full review cycle—goals provided basis for development and recognition"
    outcome: |
      Goals finally fit the work. Designers embraced craft goals as personal 
      development. Impact goals created accountability without artificial metrics. 
      Managers had substantive review conversations. High performers clearly 
      differentiated by ambition and achievement of their goals. Some tension 
      with finance/ops who wanted traditional metrics—handled with hybrid approach.
    lessons:
      - "Standard goal frameworks don't fit every role—design for the work"
      - "Craft/skill development is a valid goal category for creative/knowledge work"
      - "Goals can be evaluated qualitatively if criteria are clear"
      - "Team members set better goals when involved in designing the framework"
      - "Pilot with one team before company-wide rollout"

risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: Goals set but not reviewed
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Build check-ins into regular meeting cadence, make goals visible and public, manager accountability for goal conversations"
    
    - risk: Too many goals dilute focus
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Hard limit of 3-5 goals, force prioritization, 'if everything is important nothing is important'"
    
    - risk: Goals don't align with company direction
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Company goals set first, cascaded with context, cross-team calibration to surface disconnects"
    
    - risk: Goals are outputs not outcomes
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Train on outcome thinking, review goals for 'so what?' test, ask 'what changes if we achieve this?'"
    
    - risk: Goal-setting takes too long
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Time-box the process (2 weeks max), good-enough goals beat perfect goals, iterate next quarter"
    
    - risk: Goals become busywork theater
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Regularly survey team on goal utility, simplify when fatigue appears, connect goals to decisions and prioritization"

  organizational_risks:
    - risk: Gaming metrics over creating value
      impact: "People optimize for the measure, not the underlying intent; Goodhart's Law in action"
      prevention: "Balance quantitative key results with qualitative context, rotate metrics periodically, reward impact not just goal completion"
    
    - risk: Goal-setting becomes political
      impact: "Conservative goals to ensure success, sandbagging, credit-claiming, blame-avoiding"
      prevention: "Celebrate learning from ambitious failure, share goals publicly, focus on progress not just achievement"
    
    - risk: Individual goals conflict with team needs
      impact: "People pursue personal goals at expense of team success, collaboration decreases"
      prevention: "Include team-oriented goals, evaluate both individual and team contribution, manager calibration"

# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Goal-setting practice has evolved significantly since Intel invented OKRs 
    in the 1980s. Google's adoption and John Doerr's "Measure What Matters" 
    brought OKRs to mainstream tech. But many implementations have failed—
    research suggests only 30% of OKR implementations deliver expected benefits.
    
    Common failure modes: too many objectives, outputs disguised as outcomes, 
    annual goals in quarterly wrappers, disconnection from daily work. Success 
    factors: simplicity, visibility, regular check-ins, connection to strategy.
    
    Alternative frameworks have emerged for different contexts: Rocks (EOS) 
    for entrepreneurial organizations, Theme-based goals for creative work, 
    SMART goals for individual development. No single framework fits all—
    the best system is one the organization will actually use.
    
    The shift to remote work has made explicit goals more important—implicit 
    alignment through proximity no longer works. Goal visibility and 
    asynchronous progress tracking have become essential.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Outcome-focused key results"
      description: "Key results measure change in the world, not tasks completed"
      evidence: "Companies with outcome-focused KRs report 40% better goal achievement than output-focused"
    
    - practice: "Public goal visibility"
      description: "Goals visible to entire company, not hidden in personal documents"
      evidence: "Transparency increases accountability and enables cross-team alignment"
    
    - practice: "Regular check-ins"
      description: "Weekly or bi-weekly progress conversations, not just quarterly reviews"
      evidence: "Frequent check-ins increase goal achievement by 20-30% versus quarterly-only reviews"
    
    - practice: "Separate goal-setting from performance review"
      description: "Goals for focus and alignment, performance review for evaluation"
      evidence: "Combined systems lead to conservative goal-setting; separate systems enable ambition"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "OKR theater"

      description: "Adding more goals to cover every priority, resulting in 10+ objectives"
      consequence: "No focus, goals too numerous to remember, defeats the purpose of prioritization"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Set and forget"
      description: "Goals set in January, discovered in December during review prep"
