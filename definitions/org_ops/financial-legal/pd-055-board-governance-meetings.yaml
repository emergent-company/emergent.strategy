# OrgOps Process Definition: Board Governance Meetings
# Schema: org_ops_definition_schema.json v1.1.0
#
# Rationale for placement: Board governance is a compliance and oversight function,
# not a commercial/investor acquisition function. Commercial acquires investors;
# OrgOps handles governance, compliance, and board operations.

definition:
  purpose: |
    Governance meetings - primarily your board meetings - are the formal 
    mechanism for strategic oversight of the company. Done well, board 
    meetings provide valuable strategic input, hold leadership accountable, 
    and create a forcing function for organizational reflection.
    
    Done poorly, board meetings become performative exercises where 
    leadership presents optimistic slides, board members ask predictable 
    questions, and no real value is created. Worse, poor governance 
    creates legal and fiduciary risks.
    
    The goal is to make your board a strategic asset, not just a compliance 
    requirement. This means structuring meetings for discussion, not just 
    presentation, and treating board members as partners in building the 
    company.
    
    Warning signs of governance problems:
    - Board meetings that are all presentation, no discussion
    - Board members who seem disengaged or unprepared
    - Lack of candor about challenges and risks
    - Decisions made without proper board involvement
    - No follow-through on board action items
    
  outcome: |
    Board meetings that provide genuine strategic value, maintain proper 
    oversight, and create accountability. Board members who are engaged, 
    informed, and helpful. Governance practices that scale with the company.

  - id: ps-001
    name: "First-Time Founder Running First Board Meeting"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      First-time founder, just closed seed round. First formal board 
      meeting coming up. Board is CEO, lead investor, independent 
      advisor. Founder has never run a board meeting.
    situation: |
      Closed $2.5M seed 2 months ago. First board meeting in 2 weeks. 
      Founder nervous about running meeting and managing investor 
      expectations.
    trigger: |
      Lead investor asked to schedule first board meeting. Founder 
      needs to prepare and run meeting professionally.
    actions: |
      1. Asked lead investor for advice on meeting format. Investor 
         shared expectations and offered to help with agenda.
      2. Scheduled 3-hour meeting, 6 weeks post-close, in person at 
         investor office.
      3. Created 20-slide deck covering: company update, financials 
         (basic P&L and runway), metrics, product progress, team, 
         goals for next quarter.
      4. Sent materials 5 days ahead with cover note explaining first 
         meeting structure.
      5. Identified one strategic discussion topic: should we pursue 
         enterprise customers or stay SMB focused?
      6. Prepared for tough questions: what if growth slows, what if 
         we cannot raise Series A, etc.
      7. Ran meeting: opened with welcome, moved through updates 
         efficiently, spent 45 minutes on enterprise vs. SMB 
         discussion (valuable input received).
      8. Took notes on action items. Sent minutes within 3 days.
      9. Scheduled monthly check-in calls with each board member.
    outcome: |
      First board meeting went smoothly. Investor praised preparation 
      and openness to discussion. Strategic input on enterprise vs. 
      SMB was genuinely useful. Established good governance rhythm 
      that continued quarterly.
    lessons:
      - Ask experienced board members for guidance
      - Preparation reduces nervousness
      - Focus on one strategic topic for real discussion
      - Relationship building starts at first meeting

  - id: ps-002
    name: "CEO Managing Difficult Board Dynamics"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: |
      Series B company with 5-person board. Two investor directors 
      have different views on strategy. One pushes for aggressive 
      growth, other for profitability. Meetings have become tense.
    situation: |
      Last two board meetings featured open disagreement between 
      investor directors. CEO caught in middle. Meetings are 
      unproductive and uncomfortable.
    trigger: |
      Board chair (independent) called CEO after last meeting to 
      discuss improving board dynamics.
    actions: |
      1. CEO met with board chair to understand root cause. Chair 
         saw issue as legitimate strategic disagreement, not personal.
      2. CEO scheduled individual calls with each investor director 
         to understand their perspectives and concerns deeply.
      3. Framed next meeting around the strategic question: What is 
         the right balance between growth and profitability given 
         market conditions?
      4. Created pre-read analysis showing scenarios for different 
         approaches (aggressive growth, balanced, profitable growth) 
         with trade-offs clearly laid out.
      5. Asked board chair to facilitate strategic discussion section 
         to keep it productive.
      6. In meeting, CEO presented analysis, then chair facilitated 
         structured discussion with each member sharing perspective.
      7. Ended with CEO stating decision and rationale, informed by 
         board input but ultimately CEO's call.
      8. Established norm: healthy disagreement is good, CEO decides 
         on operations, board provides oversight.
    outcome: |
      Board dynamics improved significantly. Strategic disagreement 
      was channeled productively. Both investor directors felt heard. 
      CEO felt empowered to make decisions. Subsequent meetings were 
      more productive.
    lessons:
      - Address dynamics issues directly, not avoid them
      - Board chair is ally in managing dynamics
      - Frame disagreements as legitimate strategic questions
      - CEO decides on operations; board provides input

    name: "COO Professionalizing Board Operations"
    practitioner: "COO"
    organization_context: |
      100-person Series C company preparing for IPO in 18-24 months. 
      Board operations have been informal. Need to establish 
      professional governance practices.
    situation: |
      CEO recognizes board operations need to mature for public company 
      readiness. COO tasked with professionalizing governance without 
      making it bureaucratic.
    trigger: |
      Investment banker mentioned governance as area needing 
      improvement during IPO preparation discussion.
    actions: |
      1. Audited current state: inconsistent materials, no formal 
         minutes, no committee structure, informal meeting management.
      2. Researched best practices: reviewed public company governance 
         requirements, spoke with other pre-IPO companies.
      3. Created governance improvement plan:
         - Standardized board deck template
         - Formal minutes process
         - Audit committee establishment
         - Compensation committee establishment
         - Annual board calendar
         - Board portal for materials
      4. Proposed charter documents for audit and compensation 
         committees. Board approved.
      5. Implemented board portal (BoardEffect). Established 
         consistent process for materials.
      6. Created board meeting checklist: materials timeline, agenda 
         template, minutes template, action item tracking.
      7. Ran first improved board meeting. Solicited feedback from 
         directors on process.
      8. Established executive session as regular agenda item.
      9. Planned board evaluation for 1 year out.
    outcome: |
      Governance practices met institutional standards. Investment 
      bankers approved governance in due diligence. Board members 
      appreciated improved process. Established foundation for public 
      company governance.
    lessons:
      - Start governance improvements early, not at IPO
      - Templates and process create consistency
      - Committees provide oversight structure
      - Balance formality with efficiency

operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - Board members appointed
    - Meeting scheduling ability
    - Financial and operational data for reports
    - Basic corporate governance understanding
    
  common_blockers:
    - "Board members too busy - Schedule meetings far in advance"
    - "Meetings are unproductive - Focus on discussion, not presentation"
    - "Board is disengaged - Invest in individual relationships"
    - "Governance feels bureaucratic - Keep it simple at early stage"
    
  integration_points:
    - Quarterly Reporting: Board meeting uses same data
    - Stakeholder Updates: Board is key stakeholder
    - Legal: Corporate secretary, minutes, resolutions
    - Finance: Financial reporting for board

risks:
  if_skipped: |
    Lose strategic value of board. Miss fiduciary duties. Create legal 
    exposure. Disengage board members. Make poor decisions without 
    proper oversight.
    
  if_over_engineered: |
    Spend too much time on governance vs. operations. Create 
    bureaucracy that slows decision-making. Make meetings feel like 
    performance rather than partnership.
