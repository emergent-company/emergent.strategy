definition:
  purpose: |
    Cost structure evaluation answers a fundamental question: "Where does 
    our money go, and is it going to the right places?" Understanding your 
    cost structure isn't just about cutting expenses - it's about ensuring 
    every dollar spent contributes to your strategic objectives.
    
    Startups often operate with an incomplete picture of their costs. They 
    know headcount and rent, but miss the full picture of software tools, 
    contractors, and hidden operational costs that accumulate. A proper 
    cost structure evaluation reveals where money actually flows.
    
    More importantly, cost structure evaluation enables trade-off decisions. 
    When runway is limited, you need to know which costs are essential for 
    growth, which are investments in future capability, and which are 
    simply inertia from past decisions.
    
    Warning signs that cost structure evaluation is needed:
    - Burn rate surprises at month-end
    - Unable to explain where money goes
    - No visibility into cost-per-customer or cost-per-employee
    - Costs growing faster than revenue
    - Unclear which expenses are fixed vs. variable
    
  outcome: |
    Clear visibility into where money goes, which costs are essential vs. 
    discretionary, how the cost structure compares to industry benchmarks, 
    and actionable insights for optimizing spend against strategic priorities.

  - id: ps-001
    name: "First-Time CEO Understanding Where Money Goes"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      20-person seed-stage startup, 12 months post-raise. Burn rate seems 
      high but CEO has no breakdown of where money goes. CFO just joined 
      and wants to establish visibility.
    situation: |
      Board asked why burn is $350K/month when headcount is only 20. 
      CEO knows rough numbers but can't explain in detail. Some expenses 
      seem higher than expected but no systematic view.
    trigger: |
      Board meeting in 2 weeks. New CFO asked to do cost structure 
      analysis before meeting.
    actions: |
      1. CFO exported all expenses from QuickBooks and credit cards. 
         Matched to bank statements to ensure completeness.
      2. Categorized every expense line: people (salaries, benefits, 
         contractors), software, facilities, marketing, G&A.
      3. Created breakdown: People 65% ($227K), Software 12% ($42K), 
         Marketing 10% ($35K), Facilities 8% ($28K), G&A 5% ($18K).
      4. Investigated software ($42K/month seemed high): Found 23 
         different SaaS tools. 7 had less than 30% utilization. 3 were 
         duplicative (2 project management tools, 2 design tools).
      5. Calculated ratios: R&D 55%, S&M 28%, G&A 17%. G&A higher 
         than benchmark (should be under 15%).
      6. Identified quick wins: Cancel 4 underused tools ($5K/month), 
         renegotiate AWS contract (15% discount available), reduce 
         contractor spend by bringing function in-house.
      7. Presented to board: Clear breakdown, benchmarks, and action 
         plan to reduce burn by $30K/month (9% reduction).
    outcome: |
      Board appreciated transparency and clear plan. Implemented quick 
      wins in 30 days. Burn reduced to $320K/month. Established monthly 
      cost review rhythm. G&A dropped to 14% within 6 months.
    lessons:
      - You cannot optimize what you cannot see
      - Software sprawl is real and expensive
      - Benchmarks provide context for cost decisions
      - Quick wins build credibility before harder changes

  - id: ps-002
    name: "CFO Cutting Costs to Extend Runway"
    practitioner: "CFO"
    organization_context: |
      50-person Series A company. Fundraise delayed. Current runway is 
      8 months; need 14 months to reach metrics for Series B. Must cut 
      burn from $750K to $550K without destroying company.
    situation: |
      CEO and board agreed on target: reduce burn by 25% while 
      preserving core product and sales capacity. CFO needs to find 
      $200K/month in cuts without layoffs if possible.
    trigger: |
      Board decision: extend runway or risk running out before next 
      round. CFO has 2 weeks to present cut plan.
    actions: |
      1. Created complete cost structure breakdown by category and by 
         team. Every dollar accounted for.
      2. Classified each cost: Essential (cannot cut), Important (cut 
         carefully), Nice-to-have (can cut), Discretionary (cut first).
      3. Started with discretionary: office snacks, travel, events, 
         contractor projects on hold. Found $30K/month.
      4. Moved to nice-to-have: reduced marketing spend (performance 
         paused), consolidated software tools, froze hiring pipeline 
         vendors. Found $45K/month.
      5. Tackled important costs carefully: renegotiated office lease 
         (partial sublease), moved to cheaper cloud tier with some 
         performance trade-off, reduced contractor hours. Found $40K.
      6. Addressed compensation: implemented voluntary reduced hours 
         for interested employees, paused bonus accruals, reduced 
         executive pay 20%. Found $50K/month.
      7. Final structural changes: consolidated two teams, delayed 
         planned hires. Found $35K without layoffs.
      8. Total: $200K in cuts identified. Presented with clear impact 
         analysis for each cut.
    outcome: |
      Board approved plan. Burn reduced to $560K (slightly better than 
      target). Extended runway to 15 months. Morale impact managed 
      through transparent communication. Raised Series B 12 months 
      later with 3 months runway to spare.
    lessons:
      - Know your cost structure before you need to cut
      - Classify costs by essential vs. discretionary ahead of crisis
      - Compensation flexibility can avoid layoffs
      - Transparent communication preserves morale

      breakdown by function with trends and benchmarks.
    actions: |
      1. Implemented new chart of accounts with granular cost centers 
         aligned to public company reporting requirements.
      2. Created functional cost breakdown: R&D 32%, S&M 45%, G&A 13%, 
         COGS 10%. Mapped every employee and expense to function.
      3. Built 8-quarter trend analysis showing ratio evolution. 
         Demonstrated improving efficiency (G&A down from 18% to 13%).
      4. Benchmarked against 10 comparable public companies. Created 
         peer comparison showing where company was above/below median.
      5. Identified areas needing improvement before IPO: S&M 
         efficiency (S&M/revenue ratio higher than peers), G&A still 
         slightly high.
      6. Implemented activity-based costing for key processes: cost 
         per customer acquisition, cost per support ticket, cost per 
         engineering hour.
      7. Created forward-looking model showing path to target ratios 
         by IPO: S&M improving with scale, G&A flat while revenue grows.
      8. Established monthly cost review with executive team and 
         quarterly board deep-dive on cost efficiency.
    outcome: |
      Bankers impressed by cost structure visibility and trend. 
      Used cost analysis in S-1 narrative about path to profitability. 
      Investors appreciated operational discipline. Successful IPO 
      with strong day-one performance.
    lessons:
      - IPO-track companies need institutional cost management
      - Trend analysis is as important as current state
      - Activity-based costing reveals operational efficiency
      - Start early; building this takes time

operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - Access to financial statements and expense data
    - Chart of accounts or expense categories
    - Basic financial analysis skills
    - Benchmark data (public or from investors)
    
  common_blockers:
    - "Our data is messy - Start with what you have; clean as you go"
    - "We dont have benchmarks - Use public S-1 filings and VC data"
    - "Costs are all essential - Challenge every assumption; rarely true"
    - "We dont have time - Cost problems only get worse with delay"
    
  integration_points:
    - Accounting: Source of expense data
    - HR: Headcount and compensation data
    - IT: Software and infrastructure inventory
    - Ops: Vendor contracts and facilities

risks:
  if_skipped: |
    Burn surprises. Unable to explain where money goes. Miss 
    optimization opportunities. Overspend on non-essential items. 
    Board and investor confidence erodes.
    
  if_over_engineered: |
    Analysis paralysis. Over-index on cost cutting at expense of growth. 
    Create bureaucratic approval processes that slow execution. Track 
    minutiae that does not matter.
