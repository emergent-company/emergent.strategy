definition:
  purpose: |
    Organizations depend on vendors for tools, services, and supplies. 
    Without vendor management, contracts auto-renew at bad terms, spend 
    is untracked, and risks go unnoticed. Good vendor management saves 
    money and reduces risk.
    
  outcome: |
    All vendor relationships are documented. Contracts are reviewed before 
    renewal. Spend is tracked and optimized. Vendor performance is monitored. 
    Risks are identified and managed.
