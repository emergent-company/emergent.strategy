definition:
  purpose: |
    Without regular budget review, organizations lose visibility into cash position, 
    spend creeps up unexpectedly, and financial surprises threaten sustainability. 
    Monthly budgeting creates rhythm and accountability for financial health.
    
  outcome: |
    Clear understanding of previous month's spending vs plan. Issues identified early. 
    Cash runway is known. Next month's expected expenses are planned.

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Founder realizes they're 2 months from running out of cash"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: "8-person seed-stage startup, raised $1.5M, no finance person"
    situation: |
      Sarah (CEO) has been heads-down on product for 3 months. She checks the bank 
      account and sees $180K - much less than expected. Heart racing, she tries to 
      figure out where the money went. There are 8 salaries plus contractors plus AWS 
      plus 47 different software subscriptions. She realizes she has no idea what 
      they're actually spending each month.
    trigger: "Bank balance shock: expected $300K, found $180K"
    actions: |
      1. Sarah spends a painful Saturday pulling all bank and card statements for 
         the last 3 months. Exports to spreadsheet. Total chaos.
      2. Creates rough categories: payroll, contractors, software, cloud, other. 
         Tags each transaction. Discovers burn is $95K/month, not $75K as imagined.
      3. Finds $4K/month in forgotten software subscriptions, $8K in one-time expenses 
         that felt "necessary" at the time, and contractor scope creep.
      4. Calculates runway: 1.9 months at current burn. Panic mode.
      5. Immediately cancels 12 subscriptions ($1.8K/month saved). Ends contractor 
         who was doing "nice to have" work ($5K/month). Negotiates AWS reserved 
         instances ($2K/month saved).
      6. Creates simple budget template: expected monthly expenses by category. 
         Sets reminder to check every month on the 5th.
      7. After 2 months of discipline, burn is $82K/month. Runway extended to 
         2.5 months. Starts fundraise immediately but from stronger position.
    outcome: |
      Sarah avoided running out of cash but it was close. Key learning: tracking 
      monthly would have surfaced the problem 3 months earlier with more options. 
      Now reviews budget religiously every month - never wants that panic again.
    lessons:
      - "Check your burn rate monthly - surprises compound"
      - "Subscription creep is real - audit regularly"
      - "Know your runway number at all times"
      - "Takes only 2-3 hours/month to avoid disaster"
      - "Creating a budget forces visibility into actual spending"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "First formal budget process after Series A"
    practitioner: "Head of Finance"
    organization_context: "35-person Series A startup, just hired first finance person, growing fast"
    situation: |
      Tom just joined as Head of Finance. The company raised Series A 6 months ago 
      and is spending aggressively on hiring and growth. There's no formal budget - 
      hiring managers spend what they feel they need, and the CEO reviews major 
      purchases but has no visibility into totals. The board is asking for forecasts.
    trigger: "Board meeting in 6 weeks - need to present budget and forecast"
    actions: |
      1. Tom pulls 6 months of historical spending from QBO. Categorizes and 
         analyzes patterns. Finds: 70% of spend is people, 15% is tools/cloud, 
         15% is other. Monthly burn has grown from $200K to $320K.
      2. Meets with each department head: "What are you planning to spend next 
         quarter? What hires? What tools? What projects?" Builds bottoms-up budget.
      3. Compares to Series A fundraise plan. They're 20% over-budget on marketing, 
         on-track for engineering, under-budget on G&A (because no finance until now).
      4. Creates budget template: annual budget by department, monthly breakdown. 
         Each department head "owns" their number and explains variances.
      5. Implements monthly budget review meeting: Tom presents actuals vs budget, 
         department heads explain variances, CEO makes decisions on major items.
      6. Sets up variance thresholds: <10% = OK, 10-20% = explain, >20% = escalate.
      7. Presents to board: clear budget, runway scenarios, monthly review process. 
         Board is impressed - better than most post-Series A companies.
    outcome: |
      Company now has financial visibility. Board gets monthly update. One department 
      was significantly over-budget (sales tools) - caught and addressed. The monthly 
      rhythm prevents surprises and creates accountability.
    lessons:
      - "First formal budget: start with historical data analysis"
      - "Bottoms-up budgeting creates department ownership"
      - "Monthly review meeting creates accountability"
      - "Variance thresholds avoid nitpicking small items"
      - "Board-ready financials demonstrate operational maturity"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Cutting 30% of budget under runway pressure"
    practitioner: "CFO"
    organization_context: "60-person Series B company, market downturn, 12 months runway but investor pressure to extend"
    situation: |
      Lisa (CFO) gets direction from CEO and board: "Market has changed. Extend 
      runway from 12 months to 24 months without raising. Find 30% of costs to cut." 
      Current burn is $1.5M/month. Target: $1M/month. $500K/month needs to go - but 
      where? Every line item has an owner who will fight for it.
    trigger: "Board mandate: extend runway to 24 months without new capital"
    actions: |
      1. Lisa builds full budget by line item with owner names attached. Ranks by: 
         (a) revenue impact if cut, (b) reversibility, (c) legal/contractual commitment.
      2. Identifies "sacred" vs "negotiable" with CEO: certain roles are critical, 
         but many subscriptions and contractors are negotiable.
      3. Creates three scenarios: cut 20%, cut 30%, cut 40%. Each shows what gets cut 
         and the impact on roadmap/revenue. 30% requires layoffs; 40% requires 
         product cuts.
      4. Presents to executive team: "Here are the options. 30% cut requires reducing 
         headcount by 15 people. What functions can we consolidate or defer?"
      5. Works with HR on layoff plan. Works with Legal on contractor terminations. 
         Negotiates software contract reductions (many vendors offer discounts to 
         retain customers).
      6. Implements in phases: software cuts immediately, contractor ends over 2 weeks, 
         layoffs announced in coordinated manner.
      7. After cuts: burn is $1.05M/month. Runway extended to 21 months (close to 
         target). Monthly budget reviews become more rigorous - every dollar justified.
    outcome: |
      Painful cuts but company survived and avoided desperation fundraise. Lisa 
      learned: the budget process made cuts possible (couldn't cut what wasn't visible), 
      and the scenarios gave leadership options rather than just "cut everything."
    lessons:
      - "You can't cut what you can't see - budget visibility enables action"
      - "Scenario planning (20/30/40%) gives options, not ultimatums"
      - "Rank by revenue impact and reversibility - some cuts hurt more"
      - "Vendors often negotiate to retain customers - always ask"
      - "Post-crisis, monthly reviews become existential discipline"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Budget review delays - month drags on without closure"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Set firm deadline: budget review completed by 5th business day. Block time 
        on calendar. Use template/automation to speed process. Don't let "one more 
        thing" delay - imperfect data on time beats perfect data late.
        
    - risk: "Incomplete data - missing transactions or categories"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Integrate banking and cards with accounting software. Reconcile before review. 
        Flag "uncategorized" for attention. Regular audit of expense categories.
        
    - risk: "Department heads don't own their budgets"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Make budget ownership explicit. Include variance explanation in department 
        reviews. Tie performance to budget management. Give authority with accountability.
        
    - risk: "Forecast accuracy is poor - surprises each month"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Track recurring vs one-time expenses separately. Build in contingency (5-10% 
        buffer). Review large known expenses monthly. Improve forecast with each 
        cycle (learn from variances).
        
    - risk: "Budget becomes bureaucratic obstacle to speed"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Set appropriate thresholds (don't require approval for $50 expenses). 
        Create pre-approved categories. Focus review time on significant variances, 
        not every line item. Speed and control can coexist.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Running out of cash due to lack of visibility"
      impact: |
        Without monthly budget review, burn can creep up unnoticed. Subscription 
        sprawl, scope creep on contractors, and "necessary" one-time expenses 
        accumulate. Companies have died from this blindness.
      prevention: |
        Monthly review is non-negotiable. Know your runway at all times. Create 
        alerts for significant unexpected expenses. Review large purchases weekly 
        between monthly reviews if needed.
        
    - risk: "Budget becomes political tool rather than planning tool"
      impact: |
        When budgets are used punitively ("you're 5% over, you're in trouble") 
        rather than informatively, people game the system. Sandbagging, hiding 
        expenses, and politics undermine the purpose.
      prevention: |
        Frame budget as planning tool, not punishment. Focus on understanding 
        variances, not blaming. Allow re-forecasting when conditions change. 
        Create psychological safety for surfacing issues early.

# Domain Context - Industry Best Practices and Benchmarks
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Startup financial management has evolved with new tools (Mercury, Ramp, Brex) 
    that make tracking easier than ever. Yet many startups still lack basic financial 
    discipline - surprised by burn rate, unclear on runway, and reactive to cash crises.
    
    Post-2022 market correction raised the stakes: investors expect financial 
    discipline and unit economics understanding. "We're growing fast" is no longer 
    enough - you need to show efficient growth. Monthly budget review is table 
    stakes for institutional capital.
    
    The best companies: (1) Know their burn to within 5% accuracy, (2) Know their 
    runway number at all times, (3) Can explain variances quickly, (4) Have clear 
    paths to profitability they can articulate, (5) Make budget review a habit, 
    not a crisis response.

  best_practices:
    - "Close books by day 3 of month - budget review by day 5"
    - "Know your runway number at all times (and share with board)"
    - "Track recurring vs one-time expenses separately"
    - "Audit subscriptions quarterly - kill what's unused"
    - "Create department budget ownership - with authority and accountability"
    - "Use variance thresholds to focus attention on what matters"
    - "Build contingency into forecasts (5-10% buffer)"
    - "Review with leadership monthly - even if 'nothing significant'"
    
  anti_patterns:
    - "Only checking bank balance when worried"
    - "Detailed budget that no one looks at"
    - "Monthly review that happens quarterly"
    - "Punishing variance instead of understanding it"
    - "No distinction between committed and discretionary spend"
    - "Sandbagging budgets to always look good"
    - "Ignoring small expenses that add up"
