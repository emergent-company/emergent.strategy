definition:
  purpose: |
    Bad things happen: key people leave suddenly, systems go down, office 
    becomes inaccessible, vendor goes out of business. Without a continuity 
    plan, these events become existential crises. With a plan, they're 
    manageable disruptions.
    
  outcome: |
    Organization can continue operating if key people, systems, or facilities 
    become unavailable. Critical dependencies are documented. Response 
    procedures are known. Recovery can begin immediately.

# ============================================================
# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-015-001
    name: "First BCP Creation After Near-Miss Incident"
    practitioner: COO at 25-person company
    organization_context: |
      Growing B2B SaaS company, never had formal business continuity planning. 
      All knowledge about critical systems lives in one engineer's head. 
      CEO and COO both have personal relationships with customers—no backup. 
      Company "runs on people" with no documented processes.
    situation: |
      Sole backend engineer had a health emergency and was unreachable for 
      4 days. During that time, a production issue occurred that no one else 
      could diagnose. Customers affected. CEO realized: "We got lucky this 
      wasn't worse." Team still doesn't know how some systems work.
    trigger: |
      Engineer returned, production issue resolved. CEO in exec meeting: 
      "What if that had been 4 weeks instead of 4 days? What if it had been 
      me? We need to plan for these scenarios." Assigns COO to create first 
      business continuity plan.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Identified critical functions—what absolutely must continue if key person unavailable?"
      - "Week 1: Created 'bus factor' inventory: functions with only one person who can do them"
      - "Week 2: For each critical function, identified backup person or plan"
      - "Week 2: Engineer documented 5 most critical systems (runbooks, access, architecture)"
      - "Week 3: Created communication tree: who needs to know what, in what order, via what channel"
      - "Week 3: Identified single points of failure in vendors—what if Stripe went down?"
      - "Week 4: Wrote 3 scenario playbooks: CEO unavailable, engineer unavailable, major system down"
      - "Week 4: Tested one scenario (simulated engineer unavailability) with backup engineer"
      - "Month 2: Added BCP review to quarterly ops cadence"
      - "Month 3: Shared relevant sections with key customers (they were asking anyway)"
    outcome: |
      Within 60 days, had documented plans for 8 critical scenarios. Bus 
      factor reduced from 1 to 2 on most critical functions. New engineer 
      onboarding now includes system documentation review. When AWS outage 
      occurred 3 months later, team knew exactly what to do. Two enterprise 
      customers mentioned BCP documentation as factor in renewal decision.
    lessons:
      - "Near-miss incidents are gifts—use them to drive action before real crisis"
      - "Start with 'bus factor' analysis—what breaks if one person is unavailable?"
      - "Documentation doesn't mean bureaucracy—simple runbooks save the day"
      - "Testing scenarios reveals gaps that documents don't"
      - "Enterprise customers expect BCP—it's a sales asset"

  - id: ps-015-002
    name: "Major System Outage with BCP Activated"
    practitioner: CEO at 60-person company
    organization_context: |
      B2B SaaS with 200+ customers. Has basic BCP created 18 months ago 
      but never tested. Primary infrastructure on AWS us-east-1. No 
      multi-region failover. Customer SLA promises 99.9% uptime with 
      4-hour response time for critical issues.
    situation: |
      AWS us-east-1 experiences major outage (real event from 2021). 
      Company's entire production infrastructure is down. Customers 
      affected. Support inbox exploding. Team has never dealt with 
      anything this severe. BCP exists but no one has looked at it recently.
    trigger: |
      PagerDuty alerts at 11am. Engineering confirms: all services down, 
      nothing they can do—AWS issue. CEO pulls up BCP document and 
      realizes it's time to execute the outage playbook.
    actions:
      - "Hour 1: Activated incident response team per BCP (CEO, CTO, VP CS, VP Eng, Comms lead)"
      - "Hour 1: CTO confirmed scope—complete AWS us-east-1 outage, ETA unknown"
      - "Hour 2: Posted status page update: 'Major outage affecting all services. We're aware and monitoring.'"
      - "Hour 2: Customer success began proactive outreach to top 20 accounts"
      - "Hour 3: CEO drafted customer email, legal reviewed, sent to all customers"
      - "Hour 3: Set up internal war room (Slack channel, Zoom bridge)"
      - "Hour 4: Created customer FAQ: 'What happened, when will it be fixed, what about our data?'"
      - "Hour 6: AWS resolved issue, services began recovering"
      - "Hour 7: Confirmed full recovery, updated status page and notified customers"
      - "Day 2: Sent detailed post-mortem to all customers"
      - "Week 2: Began multi-region failover project (2-month implementation)"
    outcome: |
      6-hour outage, zero data loss. Customer response was positive—they 
      appreciated proactive communication and transparency. No customers 
      churned citing the incident. Post-mortem led to multi-region 
      infrastructure investment. BCP was validated and updated based on 
      lessons learned. Team now runs quarterly BCP drills.
    lessons:
      - "BCP value comes in execution—having a plan lets you act, not just react"
      - "Proactive communication reduces customer anxiety dramatically"
      - "Top customer outreach by humans, not just mass email, matters"
      - "Post-mortem transparency builds trust even when you failed"
      - "Every incident reveals gaps—multi-region should have been done before"

  - id: ps-015-003
    name: "CEO Medical Emergency and Succession Activation"
    practitioner: COO at 45-person company
    organization_context: |
      Series A company, CEO is founder and primary face of company. 
      All investor relationships run through CEO. Several key customer 
      relationships are CEO-personal. Board has discussed "what if" 
      scenarios but never formalized anything. COO and CEO are close 
      partners but COO has never acted as CEO.
    situation: |
      CEO has sudden medical emergency requiring extended hospitalization. 
      Prognosis is good but will be unable to work for 6-8 weeks minimum. 
      Company has investor update due, customer QBRs scheduled, and 
      potential acquisition conversation in progress. Someone needs to 
      step in immediately.
    trigger: |
      CEO's spouse calls COO: "They're in the hospital. It's serious but 
      they're going to be okay. They asked me to call you and tell you 
      to take over until they're back." COO realizes the moment they 
      abstractly planned for is happening.
    actions:
      - "Hour 1: Notified board chair, shared what was known, got confirmation of acting CEO authority"
      - "Hour 2: Called leadership team together, shared situation with sensitivity to privacy"
      - "Hour 3: Reviewed immediate calendar—what needs CEO attention in next 2 weeks?"
      - "Day 1: Called lead investor, assured continuity, rescheduled investor update to buy time"
      - "Day 1: Identified 3 customer relationships that needed personal outreach"
      - "Day 2: Communicated to full company (with CEO's permission via spouse)"
      - "Day 2: Delegated key CEO functions: CFO took investor update, VP Sales took customer QBRs"
      - "Week 1: Paused acquisition conversation—not appropriate without CEO"
      - "Week 2: Established weekly board call for duration of absence"
      - "Week 4: CEO began limited return, COO transitioned back to COO role"
      - "Week 8: Full CEO return, lessons learned session held"
    outcome: |
      Company operated effectively during 8-week CEO absence. No customer 
      relationships damaged. Investor relationship maintained. The pause 
      on acquisition was right call—it eventually resumed. Team morale 
      actually improved seeing organization handle crisis well. Formal 
      succession plan documented for the first time after the incident.
    lessons:
      - "Succession doesn't require death—extended absence is more common and still disruptive"
      - "Board chair relationship is critical for legitimizing temporary succession"
      - "Inventory of CEO relationships (investors, customers) needs to exist before crisis"
      - "Some things should be paused, not delegated—acquisition conversation was right to pause"
      - "Team handles uncertainty better when leaders are honest and organized"

      prevention: "Crisis communication plan, designated spokesperson, transparency as default"

# ============================================================
# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Business continuity planning has evolved from large enterprise concern 
    to startup necessity. The shift to cloud and remote work has changed 
    the risk landscape—traditional disasters (fire, flood) are less relevant, 
    while digital risks (outages, breaches, vendor failures) are more common.
    
    Enterprise customers increasingly require BCP documentation as part of 
    vendor assessment. SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications require BCP elements. 
    What was once "we'll figure it out" must now be documented and tested.
    
    COVID-19 was a forcing function for many companies—those with BCP 
    elements (remote work capability, communication plans) fared better 
    than those improvising. The lesson has stuck: resilience planning is 
    a competitive advantage.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Bus factor analysis"
      description: "Identify functions where only one person can perform, reduce to 2+ coverage"
      evidence: "Companies that reduce bus factor to 2+ on critical functions report 60% less disruption"
    
    - practice: "Regular testing and drills"
      description: "Test BCP scenarios at least annually, update based on lessons learned"
      evidence: "Untested BCPs fail 70% of the time in real incidents"
    
    - practice: "Communication plan priority"
      description: "BCP should focus heavily on who communicates what to whom, via which channel"
      evidence: "Communication failures are most common cause of crisis escalation"
    
    - practice: "Document critical vendor dependencies"
      description: "Know which vendors are critical, have backup plans for major ones"
      evidence: "Vendor failures are 3rd most common cause of business disruption after personnel and systems"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Write and forget"
      description: "Creating BCP document that sits in a folder, never updated or tested"
      consequence: "BCP is outdated when needed, doesn't reflect current reality"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Hero culture"
      description: "Single individuals know everything, no documentation, 'they'll always be available'"
      consequence: "Catastrophic when hero is unavailable, creates organizational fragility"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Overengineered BCP"
      description: "100-page document covering every conceivable scenario"
      consequence: "Too complex to use in crisis, never gets updated, creates false confidence"
    
    - anti_pattern: "No communication plan"
      description: "BCP focused on technical recovery without customer/stakeholder communication"
      consequence: "Technical recovery succeeds but relationships damaged by poor communication"
