definition:
  purpose: |
    Employees incur expenses on behalf of the company. Without a clear 
    process, reimbursements are delayed, policies are unclear, and 
    accounting is messy. A good expense process makes it easy to do the 
    right thing.
    
  outcome: |
    Employees understand what's reimbursable. Submission is easy. 
    Reimbursements happen promptly. Finance has accurate expense records 
    for accounting and tax purposes.
