# Rationale for placement: Stakeholder updates to existing investors and board 
# members is relationship maintenance, not investor acquisition. Commercial 
# acquires investors; OrgOps maintains ongoing investor communications.

definition:
  purpose: |
    Stakeholder updates extend beyond investors to include everyone with 
    a vested interest in your company's success: customers, partners, 
    advisors, employees (as a group), and sometimes the broader community. 
    Each group needs different information, in different formats, at 
    different frequencies.
    
    Effective stakeholder communication builds trust, creates advocates, 
    and surfaces issues before they become problems. Stakeholders who 
    feel informed and valued become assets - making introductions, 
    providing referrals, offering support during difficult times.
    
    The opposite - sporadic or one-way communication - creates stakeholders 
    who feel taken for granted. When you need their support, it's not there. 
    Worse, uninformed stakeholders may create problems by acting on 
    incomplete information.
    
    Warning signs of poor stakeholder communication:
    - Stakeholders learn news from outside sources
    - Requests for introductions or help are declined
    - Customers surprised by product changes
    - Partners feel out of the loop
    - Former advocates become neutral or negative
    
  outcome: |
    A stakeholder communication practice that keeps all key groups informed, 
    maintains strong relationships, surfaces feedback and issues early, 
    and creates a network of advocates for the company.

practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "First-Time Founder Building Stakeholder Practice"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      Post-seed startup, 12 employees. Has 8 angel investors, 3 customers, 
      2 advisors. No formal stakeholder communication practice. Angels 
      only hear from founder when there's news.
    situation: |
      One angel asked why they have not heard anything in 4 months. 
      Another mentioned feeling out of the loop. Founder realizes 
      ad-hoc communication is not working.
    trigger: |
      Advisor suggested establishing quarterly investor updates. Founder 
      decides to build proper stakeholder communication practice.
    actions: |
      1. Created stakeholder map: listed all 8 angels, 3 key customers, 
         2 advisors. Rated current relationship health (several at 2/5).
      2. Designed communication cadence:
         - Angels: Quarterly email update
         - Key customers: Monthly product updates
         - Advisors: Quarterly call
      3. Created first investor update: shared metrics, recent progress, 
         challenges, and specific asks for introductions.
      4. Sent update with personal note acknowledging past silence and 
         committing to regular updates going forward.
      5. Set up calendar reminders for ongoing cadence.
      6. Tracked responses and feedback in simple spreadsheet.
      7. Three months later, sent second quarterly update. Responses 
         were warmer, two angels offered introductions.
    outcome: |
      Angel relationships improved significantly. One angel who was 
      disengaged became active again, making valuable introduction. 
      Customers appreciated product updates and gave more product 
      feedback. Advisors more responsive when asked for help.
    lessons:
      - Stakeholders want to feel informed and valued
      - Acknowledging past gaps shows self-awareness
      - Consistency matters more than perfection
      - Small effort yields outsized relationship returns

  - id: ps-002
    name: "CEO Communicating Layoffs to Multiple Stakeholders"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: |
      100-person Series B company. Need to reduce headcount by 25% 
      due to market conditions and extended runway requirements. 
      Multiple stakeholder groups need different communications.
    situation: |
      Board approved layoffs last week. Need to communicate to 
      affected employees, remaining employees, customers, partners, 
      and investors - each with different needs and concerns.
    trigger: |
      Board meeting concluded with layoff decision. CEO has 1 week 
      to plan and execute communications before news leaks.
    actions: |
      1. Created communication plan with sequence and timing:
         - Day 1: Affected employees (HR + manager conversations)
         - Day 1 (same day, after): All-hands for remaining employees
         - Day 1 (same day, EOD): Investor email
         - Day 2: Key customer outreach (personal calls)
         - Day 2: Partner notification (calls for key partners)
         - Day 3: Blog post if appropriate for public communication
      2. Drafted messaging for each audience:
         - Employees: Why, how decisions made, support for departing
         - Investors: Business rationale, runway impact, path forward
         - Customers: No impact on service, leadership stability
         - Partners: Continued commitment, no program changes
      3. Prepared leadership team with talking points and FAQ.
      4. Executed Day 1: individual conversations with dignity, 
         all-hands with transparency, investor update with detail.
      5. Day 2: CEO personally called top 5 customers and top 3 
         partners. Reassured about stability and commitment.
      6. Monitored feedback and sentiment. Addressed concerns quickly.
      7. Week 2: Follow-up update to all stakeholders on stability.
    outcome: |
      Difficult but well-handled. Affected employees felt treated 
      fairly. Remaining team, while shaken, understood the why. 
      Zero customer churn attributed to layoffs. Partners stayed 
      committed. Investors praised the handling.
    lessons:
      - "Sequence matters - insiders before outsiders"
      - "Tailored messaging shows you understand each group"
      - "Personal outreach for key relationships"
      - "Follow-up communications show ongoing care"

    name: "VP of CS Building Customer Communication Program"
    practitioner: "VP of Customer Success"
    organization_context: |
      B2B SaaS with 150 customers. Product updates and company news 
      reach customers inconsistently. Some customers complain they 
      are surprised by changes. NPS declining.
    situation: |
      CEO asked VP CS to fix customer communications. Customers 
      are valuable stakeholders who feel out of the loop. Need 
      proactive communication program.
    trigger: |
      Major customer threatened to churn citing poor communication 
      about product changes. CEO made customer communication a priority.
    actions: |
      1. Surveyed customers: asked how they want to hear about updates, 
         what information they need, current gaps.
      2. Designed tiered communication approach:
         - All customers: Monthly newsletter (product updates, tips)
         - Enterprise customers: Quarterly business reviews
         - Key accounts: Monthly check-ins with AM
         - Product changes: Advance notice with migration guides
      3. Created customer newsletter: product updates, feature 
         spotlights, customer stories, upcoming changes.
      4. Established advance notice protocol: major changes 
         announced 30 days ahead, with migration documentation.
      5. Implemented customer advisory board for top 10 customers: 
         quarterly calls to discuss roadmap and get input.
      6. Trained CS team on proactive communication and feedback 
         collection.
      7. Measured: customer communication satisfaction score, 
         complaints about surprises, NPS trend.
    outcome: |
      Customer communication satisfaction improved from 3.2 to 4.1 
      out of 5. Complaints about surprises dropped 80%. NPS improved 
      10 points over 6 months. Customer advisory board became source 
      of product ideas and referrals.
    lessons:
      - Ask customers how they want to communicate
      - Advance notice prevents most surprise complaints
      - Tiered approach matches effort to relationship value
      - Proactive communication is cheaper than reactive retention

operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - Stakeholder list exists (even if informal)
    - Company news and updates to share
    - Basic communication tools (email, calendar)
    - Time allocated for relationship maintenance
    
  common_blockers:
    - "Too busy to communicate - Make it a scheduled priority"
    - "Nothing new to share - Share perspective, not just news"
    - "Dont want to bother them - Stakeholders want to hear from you"
    - "Bad news to deliver - Better from you than from others"
    
  integration_points:
    - CEO: Overall stakeholder strategy and investor relations
    - CS: Customer communication and feedback
    - BD: Partner communication
    - HR: Employee communication
    - Marketing: Community and public communication

risks:
  if_skipped: |
    Stakeholders feel ignored. Relationship capital erodes. Lose 
    support when you need it. Stakeholders become detractors. 
    Communication gaps filled with rumors.
    
  if_over_engineered: |
    Spend too much time communicating vs. doing. Overload stakeholders 
    with unnecessary updates. Create expectations for communication 
    volume that is not sustainable.
