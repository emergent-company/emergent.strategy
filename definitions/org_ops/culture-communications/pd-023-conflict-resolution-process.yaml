definition:
  purpose: |
    Conflict is inevitable when people work together. Unresolved conflict 
    festers, harms relationships, and reduces productivity. A clear 
    resolution process gives people tools to address issues constructively 
    before they escalate.
    
  outcome: |
    Conflicts are addressed early and constructively. There's a clear path 
    for escalation when direct resolution fails. Relationships and 
    productivity are preserved. Toxic patterns are interrupted.

# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-023-001
    name: "Resolving Conflict Between Two Senior Leaders"
    practitioner: CEO at 45-person company
    organization_context: |
      VP Engineering and VP Product have growing friction. Both are 
      valuable, high performers. Their conflict is affecting the teams 
      under them—engineers and product managers are starting to take 
      sides. CEO has noticed tension in leadership meetings but hoped 
      it would resolve itself. It hasn't.
    situation: |
      The conflict has become visible. In a leadership meeting, VP 
      Engineering publicly criticized VP Product's roadmap priorities. 
      VP Product escalated to CEO: "I can't work with them anymore." 
      Other leaders are uncomfortable. CEO realizes they need to 
      intervene before this damages the organization.
    trigger: |
      VP Product gives CEO an ultimatum: "Either you do something 
      about this, or I'm looking for another job." CEO realizes this 
      is now urgent—losing either leader would be costly.
    actions:
      - "Day 1: CEO met privately with VP Product—listened without defending VP Engineering"
      - "Day 1: Asked: 'What would a good resolution look like for you?'"
      - "Day 2: CEO met privately with VP Engineering—same approach, no judgment"
      - "Day 2: Found common ground: both wanted same outcome (product success), disagreed on process"
      - "Day 3: CEO proposed joint conversation with clear ground rules"
      - "Day 3: Structured session: each person shares perspective (5 min, uninterrupted), CEO summarizes, identify shared goals"
      - "Day 3: Joint conversation revealed core issue: lack of shared planning process, not personal animosity"
      - "Day 3: Agreed on new working model: weekly sync, shared roadmap document, escalation path"
      - "Week 2: CEO checked in with both—new process working, tension reduced"
      - "Month 2: Quarterly 360 feedback showed improved collaboration scores"
    outcome: |
      Conflict resolved without losing either leader. The structured 
      intervention revealed the conflict was about process, not 
      personality. New working model addressed root cause. Team-level 
      tension dissipated once leaders modeled collaboration. CEO learned 
      to intervene earlier—waiting for "self-resolution" allowed 
      escalation.
    lessons:
      - "Leader conflict can poison teams quickly—intervene early"
      - "Individual conversations first—understand each perspective before joint session"
      - "Most conflicts are about process or expectations, not personality"
      - "Structured conversations with ground rules enable productive dialogue"
      - "Follow-up is essential—agreements need reinforcement"

  - id: ps-023-002
    name: "Handling Interpersonal Conflict with Power Imbalance"
    practitioner: HR Manager at 35-person company
    organization_context: |
      Senior engineer (5 years tenure, informal authority) and junior 
      engineer (6 months) are in conflict. Junior engineer feels bullied—
      senior engineer dismisses their ideas, makes sarcastic comments, 
      excludes them from technical discussions. Senior engineer says 
      junior "can't take feedback" and is "too sensitive."
    situation: |
      Junior engineer comes to HR in tears after a particularly harsh 
      code review. They're considering quitting. Senior engineer is 
      valued for technical skills but has had similar conflicts before. 
      Engineering manager is aware but hasn't addressed it effectively—
      they're intimidated by the senior engineer.
    trigger: |
      Junior engineer files formal complaint with HR: "I'm being 
      bullied. I've tried to address it directly and with my manager, 
      but nothing changes. I need help or I'm leaving."
    actions:
      - "Day 1: HR Manager met with junior engineer—documented specific incidents, asked what resolution they want"
      - "Day 1: Junior engineer wanted behavior to change, not punishment"
      - "Day 2: HR Manager met with engineering manager—understood why they hadn't addressed effectively"
      - "Day 2: HR Manager met with senior engineer—shared observations without accusation"
      - "Day 2: Senior engineer defensive at first, then acknowledged 'maybe I'm too direct'"
      - "Day 3: HR Manager facilitated joint conversation with both engineers and engineering manager"
      - "Day 3: Agreed on specific behavior changes: senior engineer will give feedback in private, use constructive language"
      - "Day 3: Junior engineer will ask for clarification instead of assuming ill intent"
      - "Week 2: HR Manager checked in with both—improved but still some friction"
      - "Week 4: Follow-up showed sustained improvement, junior engineer feeling included"
      - "Month 2: Senior engineer received feedback training as part of development plan"
    outcome: |
      Junior engineer stayed and thrived. Senior engineer moderated 
      behavior—not transformed, but workably professional. Engineering 
      manager learned to address conflicts earlier. Pattern established: 
      HR is available for mediation, but first line is direct conversation 
      and manager involvement.
    lessons:
      - "Power imbalance requires HR involvement—direct conversation may not be safe"
      - "Understand what resolution looks like for the complainant—not everyone wants punishment"
      - "Senior employees often don't realize their impact—feedback without accusation works"
      - "Manager involvement is essential—they own the ongoing relationship"
      - "Follow-up is critical—one conversation rarely changes behavior permanently"

  - id: ps-023-003
    name: "Cross-Functional Conflict That Becomes Systemic"
    practitioner: COO at 70-person company
    organization_context: |
      Sales and Customer Success are in constant conflict. Sales makes 
      promises to close deals; CS inherits problems. CS complains about 
      sales; sales says CS doesn't understand revenue pressure. Individual 
      conflicts between team members reflect organizational misalignment. 
      Both VPs blame each other in leadership meetings.
    situation: |
      Third customer escalation this month where sales promises didn't 
      match product capability. CS VP is furious, threatening to escalate 
      every deal before close. Sales VP says CS is "blocking revenue." 
      CEO asks COO to fix the dysfunction.
    trigger: |
      Enterprise customer threatens contract termination due to 
      "misalignment between what we were sold and what we got." 
      CEO says: "This is now a strategic problem, not an interpersonal 
      one. We need a systemic fix."
    actions:
      - "Week 1: COO interviewed 8 people from both teams—documented patterns, not just incidents"
      - "Week 1: Pattern emerged: incentives misaligned (sales paid on close, CS paid on retention)"
      - "Week 1: No clear handoff process—sales 'throws deals over the wall'"
      - "Week 2: COO presented analysis to both VPs together: 'This isn't about people, it's about systems'"
      - "Week 2: Both VPs agreed on root causes once framed as systemic"
      - "Week 3: Redesigned handoff process: CS involved in late-stage deals, sign-off required"
      - "Week 3: Adjusted incentives: sales comp now includes 90-day retention component"
      - "Week 3: Created shared Slack channel for deal questions (transparency, not handoff)"
      - "Month 1: Implemented changes, weekly check-in between VPs and COO"
      - "Month 3: Escalations dropped by 70%, customer retention improved"
    outcome: |
      Cross-functional conflict resolved by addressing root causes, 
      not individuals. Sales and CS still have healthy tension (different 
      perspectives) but productive collaboration. VPs model constructive 
      disagreement. The individual conflicts that triggered the 
      intervention mostly resolved once systems aligned incentives.
    lessons:
      - "Patterns of conflict often signal systemic issues, not just personality clashes"
      - "Incentive misalignment causes predictable conflict—fix incentives, fix behavior"
      - "Framing as 'systemic' removes personal blame and enables collaborative problem-solving"
      - "Process changes (handoffs, transparency) reduce friction from unclear ownership"
      - "Leader alignment (VP-to-VP) must precede team-level improvement"

# RISKS
# ============================================================
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: Conflict avoided instead of resolved
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Manager training on conflict facilitation, escalation path to HR, normalize conflict resolution"
    
    - risk: Mediator takes sides or is perceived as biased
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Structured process, equal airtime, focus on behavior not character, escalate if can't be neutral"
    
    - risk: Resolution doesn't stick
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Document agreements, scheduled follow-up, manager accountability for ongoing relationship"
    
    - risk: Retaliation after complaint
      likelihood: low
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Clear anti-retaliation policy, monitoring after resolution, confidential reporting channel"
    
    - risk: Escalation when de-escalation is possible
      likelihood: medium
      impact: low
      mitigation: "Encourage direct conversation first, manager mediation before HR, proportional response"

  organizational_risks:
    - risk: Toxic individuals protected by value
      impact: "Pattern of conflict tolerated because person is high performer, culture erodes"
      prevention: "High performers held to same standards, 'brilliant jerks' addressed, values enforcement"
    
    - risk: Conflict avoidance culture
      impact: "Issues fester, resentment builds, eventually explodes or people leave"
      prevention: "Normalize healthy conflict, reward constructive disagreement, address avoidance patterns"
    
    - risk: Over-involvement of HR
      impact: "Every disagreement becomes HR issue, managers don't own team dynamics"
      prevention: "HR as escalation path, not first resort; manager training and accountability"

# ============================================================
# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Workplace conflict is inevitable and, managed well, can be constructive. 
    Research shows teams that engage in healthy conflict outperform those 
    that avoid it. The challenge is distinguishing productive disagreement 
    from destructive friction.
    
    Modern approaches emphasize early intervention, structured dialogue, 
    and systemic analysis. The trend is toward conflict competence—teaching 
    everyone to handle disagreements—rather than relying on HR for 
    mediation.
    
    Remote and hybrid work has complicated conflict dynamics. Misunderstandings 
    are more common without nonverbal cues. Written communication can 
    escalate quickly. Proactive relationship-building becomes more important.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Address early"
      description: "Intervene at first signs of conflict, not when it's visibly toxic"
      evidence: "Early intervention resolves 80% of conflicts; late intervention resolves 30%"
    
    - practice: "Assume good intent"
      description: "Start with assumption that both parties want positive outcome"
      evidence: "Charitable interpretation reduces defensiveness and enables resolution"
    
    - practice: "Separate behavior from character"
      description: "Address what someone did, not who they are"
      evidence: "Behavior feedback is actionable; character feedback is attack"
    
    - practice: "Look for systemic causes"
      description: "Patterns of conflict often indicate process or incentive misalignment"
      evidence: "Systemic fixes have lasting impact; individual fixes recur"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Hoping it resolves itself"
      description: "Avoiding conflict intervention, assuming adults will work it out"
      consequence: "Conflict escalates, affects more people, becomes harder to resolve"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Taking sides"
      description: "Manager or HR aligns with one party"
      consequence: "Other party feels unheard, trust in process destroyed"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Win/lose framing"
      description: "Treating conflict resolution as determining who was right"
      consequence: "Loser resentful, relationship permanently damaged"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Conflict as career killer"
      description: "Being involved in conflict seen as mark against employee"
      consequence: "Conflicts go unreported, fester underground"
