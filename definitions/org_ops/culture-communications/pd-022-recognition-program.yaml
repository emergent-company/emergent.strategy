definition:
  purpose: |
    People want to feel appreciated for their contributions. Without 
    recognition, good work goes unnoticed and motivation suffers. 
    Recognition programs make appreciation visible, reinforce values, 
    and build positive culture.
    
  outcome: |
    Good work is noticed and appreciated. Recognition happens regularly 
    across the organization. Values are reinforced through what gets 
    recognized. Employees feel valued for their contributions.

    - Connect to impact or value
    - Be timely (close to the event)
    - Make it genuine (not obligatory)
    
  examples:
    good: |
      "Shout out to @Maya for her work on the customer presentation 
      yesterday. She stayed late to help the sales team prepare, and 
      the customer was impressed with the depth of the demo. This is 
      exactly what 'customer obsession' looks like!"
    weak: |
      "Thanks Maya for your help."
