definition:
  purpose: |
    Teams need rhythm and connection. Without intentional rituals, meetings 
    become ad hoc, relationships stay shallow, and culture forms by accident. 
    Rituals create predictability, build trust, and reinforce values.
    
  outcome: |
    Team has regular touchpoints that serve clear purposes. Members know 
    what to expect and when. There's space for work coordination, personal 
    connection, and reflection. Culture is reinforced through repeated practices.
