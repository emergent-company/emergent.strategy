definition:
  purpose: |
    Values are how we decide when there's no clear answer. Without explicit 
    values, decisions are inconsistent and culture forms by accident. 
    Defined values create alignment and help with hiring, conflict 
    resolution, and strategic choices.
    
  outcome: |
    Organization has clearly articulated values that reflect who they are 
    and who they aspire to be. People can reference values when making 
    decisions. Values are used in hiring and reinforced in practice.

# ============================================================
# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-021-001
    name: "First-Time Values Definition for a Growing Startup"
    practitioner: CEO at 15-person startup
    organization_context: |
      Company grew from 4 to 15 people in one year. Culture was implicit—
      founders' behavior set the tone. Now hiring 5 more people, and new 
      hires ask "what's the culture here?" CEO realizes they can't just 
      absorb culture by osmosis anymore. Need to codify what matters.
    situation: |
      Two recent hires don't fit. One was technically strong but dismissive 
      of customers. Another was nice but wouldn't take ownership. CEO had 
      gut sense during interviews but couldn't articulate what was off. 
      Team members asking: "Are we the kind of company that works weekends?" 
      "Is it okay to push back on founders?" No clear answers.
    trigger: |
      Third hire in a row feels wrong. HR advisor says: "You need to define 
      your values. Not for the website—for hiring and decision-making." 
      CEO commits to articulating what's actually true about how they work.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: CEO reflected on best moments in company history—what behaviors drove success?"
      - "Week 1: Identified worst moments—what behaviors caused pain?"
      - "Week 2: Had 1:1s with 8 team members asking: 'What do you think makes us different?'"
      - "Week 2: Looked for patterns—same themes emerging from multiple conversations"
      - "Week 3: Drafted 5 candidate values with 1-paragraph descriptions each"
      - "Week 3: Tested draft: 'Would we hire someone who didn't have this? Would we fire someone who violated this?'"
      - "Week 3: Eliminated 2 values that failed the test (they were nice-to-haves, not essentials)"
      - "Week 4: Shared 3 final values with team for feedback, refined language"
      - "Week 4: Published values internally with examples of 'looks like' and 'doesn't look like'"
      - "Month 2: Integrated into hiring—added values interview, trained team on questions"
    outcome: |
      Final values: (1) "Customer problems first" (2) "Own your work" 
      (3) "Say the hard thing." Each had clear description and examples. 
      Team said: "This is actually what we do—just written down." Next 
      5 hires much better. Could articulate during interviews what they 
      were looking for. One candidate self-selected out: "This doesn't 
      sound like me." Saved everyone time.
    lessons:
      - "Values come from observing what's already true, not aspirations"
      - "Team input reveals shared patterns founders might not articulate"
      - "Fewer values (3-5) are more useful than comprehensive lists"
      - "The 'hire/fire' test eliminates nice-to-haves"
      - "Values must have examples to be actionable"

  - id: ps-021-002
    name: "Revising Values After Scaling Creates Dysfunction"
    practitioner: COO at 80-person Series B company
    organization_context: |
      Company defined values at 20 people, 4 years ago. Now 80 people. 
      Original values: "Move fast," "Customer obsession," "One team." 
      But moving fast now creates chaos. "Customer obsession" is used to 
      justify bypassing process. "One team" means no one can say no. Values 
      became shields for dysfunction.
    situation: |
      Leadership team recognizes values need revision. Not because they 
      were wrong—they were right for 20-person startup. But company is 
      different now. "Move fast" at scale means "break everything." Need 
      to evolve values while respecting origin and not demoralizing team.
    trigger: |
      Major customer escalation. Sales promised feature that broke product 
      roadmap. When challenged, salesperson said: "Customer obsession—I 
      did the right thing." Engineering frustrated. CEO says: "Our values 
      are being weaponized. We need to fix this."
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Leadership offsite to diagnose—which values are causing problems and why?"
      - "Week 1: Realized values weren't wrong, but lacked nuance for scale"
      - "Week 2: Surveyed company: 'What do our values mean to you? What's working? What's not?'"
      - "Week 2: Found common themes: speed vs stability, customer vs team, individual vs collective"
      - "Week 3: Drafted revised values—not new values, evolved values with more precision"
      - "Week 3: 'Move fast' → 'Move fast, together' (added coordination requirement)"
      - "Week 3: 'Customer obsession' → 'Sustainable customer success' (added sustainability)"
      - "Week 4: Tested with trusted team members before broad rollout"
      - "Week 4: All-hands to explain evolution—not rejection of past, maturation for scale"
      - "Week 5: Updated hiring questions, performance review criteria, decision frameworks"
    outcome: |
      Team received the evolution well because it addressed real pain. 
      The addition of "together" to "move fast" legitimized coordination 
      requests without killing speed. "Sustainable customer success" gave 
      product and engineering vocabulary to push back on unreasonable 
      sales promises. Within 2 quarters, cross-functional conflicts 
      decreased and customer satisfaction improved.
    lessons:
      - "Values should evolve with company stage—rigid values become dysfunction"
      - "Diagnose the problem before revising—what specifically is breaking?"
      - "Evolution is better received than revolution—honor the origin"
      - "Involve the team—they experience the dysfunction and own the solution"
      - "Update all systems that touch values—hiring, reviews, decisions"

  - id: ps-021-003
    name: "Values Definition After Merger of Two Startups"
    practitioner: CEO of combined entity, 45 people
    organization_context: |
      Two complementary startups merged—one product-focused (25 people), 
      one sales-focused (20 people). Each had strong cultures and implicit 
      values. Now combined, cultural clash is immediate. Product team sees 
      sales team as pushy and short-term. Sales team sees product team as 
      slow and precious. Need unified culture fast.
    situation: |
      Two months post-merger, tension is visible. Product and sales teams 
      eat lunch separately. Decisions stall because each side assumes bad 
      intent. Retention risk: top performers on both sides wondering if 
      they fit in the new company. CEO needs to create shared identity 
      without erasing what made each team great.
    trigger: |
      Two key employees resign within a week—one from each original company. 
      Exit interviews reveal: "I don't recognize this place anymore" and 
      "The other team's culture is winning." CEO realizes culture crisis 
      is existential. Commits to explicit values process within 30 days.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Acknowledged the problem publicly—'We haven't defined who we are together'"
      - "Week 1: Created mixed working group (4 from each original company + 2 new hires)"
      - "Week 2: Working group interviewed 15 people: 'What did you love about original culture? What do you want in the new one?'"
      - "Week 2: Found surprising overlap—both teams valued ownership, customer focus, learning"
      - "Week 2: Identified genuine differences—product valued craft, sales valued speed"
      - "Week 3: Drafted unified values that honored both: 'Craft that sells' combined excellence with pragmatism"
      - "Week 3: Each value had input from both original cultures—no winner/loser"
      - "Week 3: CEO shared draft with both original CEOs (now execs) for buy-in"
      - "Week 4: All-hands launch—each value presented by mixed pair (one from each original company)"
      - "Week 4: Announced 'culture council' to monitor values integration and address friction"
    outcome: |
      Values launch stopped the bleeding. The process itself (mixed working 
      group, shared presentation) was as important as the output. Teams 
      saw that new culture wasn't one side winning. "Craft that sells" 
      became rallying cry that both sides could own. Six months later, 
      integrated culture stabilized. Still some friction but shared 
      vocabulary for resolving it.
    lessons:
      - "Merger requires explicit culture work—implicit cultures will clash"
      - "The process of defining values is as important as the values themselves"
      - "Find genuine overlap—merged cultures often share more than they realize"
      - "Honor both origins—no winning or losing culture"
      - "Monitor and maintain—culture integration is ongoing, not one-time event"

# RISKS
# ============================================================
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: Values are too generic
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Apply distinctiveness test—would competitors say the same thing? Use 'Netflix test': would we be unusual for having this value?"
    
    - risk: Values are aspirational, not actual
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Ground in observed behavior, not wishful thinking. Ask: 'Can we name 3 people who exemplify this?'"
    
    - risk: Too many values to remember
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Limit to 3-5 values. If you can't recite them, neither can the team."
    
    - risk: Values defined but not integrated
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Update hiring, reviews, promotions, decisions. Values without integration are wall art."
    
    - risk: Leader behavior contradicts stated values
      likelihood: medium
      impact: critical
      mitigation: "360 feedback on leader adherence, visible accountability when leaders violate values"

  organizational_risks:
    - risk: Values become shields for bad behavior
      impact: "Values weaponized to justify dysfunction ('move fast' justifies skipping important steps)"
      prevention: "Values need 'looks like / doesn't look like' examples, regular review of how values are invoked"
    
    - risk: Cynicism about values exercise
      impact: "Team views values as corporate BS, disengages from culture work"
      prevention: "Ground in real examples, acknowledge when values aren't lived, follow through on accountability"
    
    - risk: Values resist necessary evolution
      impact: "What worked at 20 people breaks at 100—values become sacred cows"
      prevention: "Build in regular review cadence, treat values as living documents, evolve rather than abandon"

# ============================================================
# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Company values went through phases: 1990s poster-on-wall platitudes, 
    2000s Enron-driven skepticism, 2010s tech culture manifestos. Today's 
    best practice recognizes values as operating system for culture—not 
    marketing but management tools.
    
    The Netflix culture deck (2009) reset expectations for what company 
    values could be: specific, behavioral, sometimes controversial. Companies 
    like Bridgewater (radical transparency), Stripe (high standards), and 
    Gitlab (handbook-first) have shown that distinctive values create 
    distinctive cultures.
    
    Remote work has increased value of explicit values—when you can't absorb 
    culture by osmosis, codification matters more. Values increasingly 
    function as decision-making frameworks rather than hiring filters.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Fewer, more distinctive values (3-5)"
      description: "Limit values to what people can remember and use daily"
      evidence: "Companies with fewer than 5 values report 2x higher value recall and application"
    
    - practice: "Behavioral examples for each value"
      description: "Define 'looks like' and 'doesn't look like' for each value"
      evidence: "Values with behavioral examples are applied 3x more consistently in reviews"
    
    - practice: "Ground in reality, not aspiration"
      description: "Values describe how you actually operate, not how you wish to"
      evidence: "Aspirational values are 4x more likely to become cynicism generators"
    
    - practice: "Integrate into all people systems"
      description: "Values reflected in hiring, reviews, promotions, terminations"
      evidence: "Values integration correlates with 2.5x higher cultural consistency across locations"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Generic value set"
      description: "Integrity, excellence, teamwork, innovation, customer focus"
      consequence: "Indistinguishable from every other company, provides no decision guidance"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Values as wall art"
      description: "Values prominently displayed but never referenced in decisions"
      consequence: "Breeds cynicism, signals that stated culture is performative"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Founder-only values definition"
      description: "CEO defines values in isolation, announces to team"
      consequence: "Values may not reflect actual culture, less buy-in, feels imposed"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Values immune from evolution"
      description: "Original values treated as sacred, never revised"
