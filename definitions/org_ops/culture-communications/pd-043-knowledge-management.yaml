    effort: "Dedicated knowledge function"

definition:
  purpose: |
    Institutional knowledge is valuable but easily lost. When knowledge 
    lives only in people's heads, it leaves when they do. A knowledge 
    management system captures, organizes, and shares knowledge so 
    everyone can benefit.
    
  outcome: |
    Critical knowledge is documented. Information is findable. 
    Onboarding is faster. Mistakes aren't repeated. Expertise is 
    accessible beyond the expert.

# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-043-001
    name: "Rebuilding Knowledge After Key Departure"
    practitioner: CTO at 40-person company
    organization_context: |
      Founding engineer (7 years tenure) leaves for new opportunity. 
      They were the "oracle"—knew everything about the system, why 
      decisions were made, where the bodies are buried. Documentation 
      was always "on the list" but never prioritized. Now critical 
      knowledge is walking out the door.
    situation: |
      Engineer gives 2-week notice. CTO realizes the depth of 
      undocumented knowledge: infrastructure architecture, why certain 
      workarounds exist, vendor relationships, historical context. 
      Team will be left guessing. Some knowledge may be permanently 
      lost.
    trigger: |
      In knowledge transfer meeting, departing engineer says: "I 
      don't even know where to start. I've just been doing this so 
      long, I don't know what I know." CTO realizes this is bigger 
      than a 2-week handoff.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: CTO scheduled intensive knowledge extraction sessions—recording everything"
      - "Week 1: Organized by system area: infrastructure, deployment, integrations, historical decisions"
      - "Week 1: Other engineers asked questions they'd always wanted to ask—documented answers"
      - "Week 1: Created 'decision log' documenting WHY things are the way they are"
      - "Week 2: Engineer pair-programmed through critical systems with designated inheritors"
      - "Week 2: Recorded screen shares of complex processes"
      - "Week 2: Captured tribal knowledge in searchable wiki format"
      - "Post-departure: Identified knowledge gaps as they emerged—documented what 'we don't know'"
      - "Month 1: Established ongoing documentation practice: 'never let this happen again'"
      - "Month 3: Made documentation part of definition of done for all work"
    outcome: |
      Captured ~70% of critical knowledge before departure. First 
      month post-departure was rough—team hit gaps they hadn't 
      anticipated. Over time, documentation culture improved. CTO 
      learned expensive lesson: document continuously, not in crisis.
    lessons:
      - "Single points of knowledge failure are organizational risk—mitigate proactively"
      - "Crisis documentation captures urgency but is inherently incomplete"
      - "Record video/screen shares—some knowledge is procedural, hard to write"
      - "Document 'why' not just 'what'—decisions without context become mysteries"
      - "Make documentation ongoing practice, not departure scramble"

  - id: ps-043-002
    name: "Creating Documentation Culture from Nothing"
    practitioner: Head of Operations at 30-person company
    organization_context: |
      Company has grown fast. Processes exist in people's heads. 
      Every question requires finding the right person. New hires 
      are overwhelmed—there's no onboarding documentation, no 
      process guides, no "how we do things here." Leadership 
      recognizes the problem but doesn't know where to start.
    situation: |
      New operations hire (week 3) escalates to CEO: "I can't do my 
      job. I don't know how anything works here, and everyone's too 
      busy to explain. I'm questioning whether this was the right 
      move." CEO realizes documentation debt is affecting retention 
      and productivity.
    trigger: |
      CEO tells Head of Operations: "I want us to have a knowledge 
      base that a new hire can use to be productive within a week. 
      Figure out how to make that happen."
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Head of Ops audited what documentation exists—scattered Google Docs, some Notion, mostly nothing"
      - "Week 1: Chose single tool (Notion) as canonical knowledge base"
      - "Week 2: Started with onboarding—documented 'first week' experience as the new hire experienced it"
      - "Week 2: New hire became documentation partner—'document as you learn' approach"
      - "Week 3: Established structure: Company, Teams, Processes, Tools"
      - "Week 3: Assigned documentation 'owners' for each section—accountability, not just authorship"
      - "Week 4: Leadership wrote 'Company' section—mission, values, strategy (set the tone)"
      - "Month 1: Required each team to document their 'How We Work' basics"
      - "Month 2: Made documentation searchable and discoverable—no more 'where is that doc?'"
      - "Month 3: Added to performance expectations: 'maintains team documentation'"
    outcome: |
      Within 3 months, core documentation in place. Next hire had 
      dramatically better onboarding. Culture shift started—people 
      began linking to docs instead of explaining repeatedly. 
      Documentation became living system, not static artifact.
    lessons:
      - "Start with onboarding—highest ROI documentation for growing companies"
      - "New hires make excellent documentation partners—fresh eyes, motivated learners"
      - "Choose one tool and commit—scattered docs are worse than no docs"
      - "Assign owners, not just authors—ownership creates maintenance accountability"
      - "Make it searchable—documentation that can't be found doesn't exist"

  - id: ps-043-003
    name: "Maintaining Documentation in Fast-Moving Team"
    practitioner: Engineering Lead at 50-person company
    organization_context: |
      Engineering team has good documentation practices established. 
      But as team grows and moves faster, documentation lags. 
      Architecture docs are months old. API documentation is 
      incomplete. Engineers complain docs are unreliable—they've 
      learned to ignore them and read the code.
    situation: |
      New API launched without documentation. Consuming team wastes 
      2 days figuring out how to integrate. When they complain, 
      publishing team says: "We were moving fast. Documentation 
      slows us down." Engineering Lead realizes docs have become 
      optional, not integral.
    trigger: |
      CEO observes in all-hands: "I hear we have documentation 
      problems. This seems like it's costing us velocity, not 
      saving it." Engineering Lead is asked to fix it.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Engineering Lead audited documentation state—classified as current, stale, missing"
      - "Week 1: Found: 30% current, 40% stale, 30% missing (worse than expected)"
      - "Week 2: Identified root cause: documentation not part of 'done'—ships without docs"
      - "Week 2: Proposed: 'No merge without docs' policy for APIs and architecture changes"
      - "Week 2: Established lightweight doc templates—reduced friction of 'how do I document this?'"
      - "Week 3: Added documentation check to PR review—reviewers verify docs match code"
      - "Week 3: Created 'documentation debt' tracker—visible backlog of stale docs"
      - "Month 1: Allocated 10% of sprint capacity to documentation catch-up"
      - "Month 2: Current docs jumped to 75%—stale/missing decreased"
      - "Month 3: Feedback from consuming teams: 'Documentation is actually useful now'"
    outcome: |
      Documentation became reliable again. Engineers started trusting 
      docs, reducing "read the code" cycles. API launches included 
      documentation by default. Initial velocity "cost" of writing 
      docs was more than offset by reduced integration confusion.
    lessons:
      - "Documentation must be part of definition of done—optional means absent"
      - "Stale documentation is worse than no documentation—creates false confidence"
      - "Templates reduce friction—make documentation easy to do right"
      - "PR review is checkpoint for docs—catches gaps before merge"
      - "Allocate explicit capacity for documentation debt—it won't happen otherwise"

# ============================================================
# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Knowledge management is essential for scaling organizations. 
    Small teams can operate on shared context and verbal knowledge 
    transfer. As organizations grow, this breaks down—you can't be 
    in every conversation, and new hires can't absorb 5 years of 
    context by osmosis.
    
    Modern knowledge management emphasizes: searchability, living 
    documentation, distributed ownership, and integration with work 
    tools. The shift is from "documentation as artifact" to 
    "documentation as process."
    
    Remote and distributed work has accelerated documentation needs. 
    Without casual observation and hallway conversations, explicit 
    knowledge capture becomes essential, not optional.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Write for discovery"
      description: "Structure and title for searchability—people find docs by searching"
      evidence: "Docs with clear titles and headers are 3x more likely to be found and used"
    
    - practice: "Document as you work"
      description: "Capture knowledge in the moment—not as separate documentation project"
      evidence: "Real-time documentation is 5x more likely to be accurate than retrospective"
    
    - practice: "Assign owners, not authors"
      description: "Every doc has accountable owner for maintenance"
      evidence: "Owned docs stay current; orphan docs go stale within months"
    
    - practice: "Link aggressively"
      description: "Connect related documents—create web of knowledge"
      evidence: "Linked docs are more discoverable and provide richer context"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Documentation as project"
      description: "Periodic 'documentation sprints' instead of ongoing practice"
      consequence: "Docs become project, then debt, then abandoned—cycle repeats"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Knowledge hoarding"
      description: "Information as power—individuals gatekeep knowledge"
      consequence: "Organizational fragility, bottlenecks, political dysfunction"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Write-only documentation"
      description: "Docs created but never read or maintained"
      consequence: "Documentation theater—effort without value, trust erodes"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Tool proliferation"
      description: "Docs scattered across Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, Slack, email"
      consequence: "Unfindable knowledge, duplicated effort, confusion"
