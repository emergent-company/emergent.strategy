definition:
  purpose: |
    Employees need a single source of truth for policies and expectations. 
    Verbal policies are inconsistent and create risk. A handbook documents 
    expectations, protects the company legally, and provides employees 
    with clear guidance.
    
  outcome: |
    All employees have access to documented policies. Expectations are 
    consistent. Legal protections are in place. New hires understand 
    the company norms quickly.
