definition:
  purpose: |
    Without explicit communication norms, teams develop inconsistent practices that 
    lead to meeting fatigue, unclear expectations, and collaboration friction. 
    Especially in remote/hybrid environments, unclear norms cause anxiety and 
    inefficiency. This process establishes explicit team agreements.
    
  outcome: |
    Team has documented, agreed-upon communication norms that everyone understands. 
    New members can quickly learn expectations. Friction from mismatched 
    expectations is reduced.
