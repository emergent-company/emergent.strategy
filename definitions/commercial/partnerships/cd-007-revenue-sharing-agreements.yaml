definition:
  purpose: |
    Revenue sharing agreements define how money is divided between 
    parties who collaborate to generate revenue. These arrangements 
    align incentives and compensate partners for their contributions 
    to customer acquisition, retention, or value delivery.
    
    Common revenue share scenarios:
    
    1. Referral programs: Partner introduces customers, receives 
       percentage of revenue.
    
    2. Reseller/distribution: Partner sells your product, keeps 
       margin or percentage.
    
    3. White-label/embedded: Partner embeds your product, shares 
       end customer revenue.
    
    4. Marketplace/platform: You provide platform, partners sell, 
       you take percentage.
    
    5. Co-sell: Joint sales effort, revenue split reflects contribution.
    
    Why getting revenue share right matters:
    
    1. Alignment creates effort. Partners work harder when economics 
       are meaningful and fair.
    
    2. Wrong rates cause problems. Too low, partners do not engage. 
       Too high, you cannot sustain.
    
    3. Complexity kills. Partners stop referring if tracking is 
       confusing or payment is unreliable.
    
    4. Conflicts emerge. Disputes about attribution, payment, and 
       fairness damage relationships.
    
  outcome: |
    Revenue sharing structures that motivate partner engagement while 
    maintaining unit economics. Clear attribution and tracking. 
    Reliable payment processes. Sustainable partner economics.

            - "Investment in enablement"
        customer_success:
          goal: "Quality customers, retention"
          implications:
            - "Align on customer quality"
            - "Consider retention-based share"
            - "Ongoing vs. one-time"
      economic_constraints:
        ltv_based:
          principle: "Share portion of customer LTV"
          calculation: "LTV × acceptable share percentage"
          typical_ranges:
            - "Referral: 10-20% first year"
            - "Reseller: 15-40% ongoing"
            - "White-label: 20-50% ongoing"
        cac_based:
          principle: "Compare to alternative CAC"
          calculation: "What would we pay to acquire?"
          guidance: "Should be below direct acquisition cost"

    name: "Founder Structuring First Referral Program"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      Seed-stage SaaS, 20 customers. Several existing customers 
      have offered to refer other companies. Founder wants to 
      formalize referral program.
    situation: |
      Three customers have referred 5 new customers informally. 
      Founder gave them free months as thanks. Want to scale this 
      but unsure what to pay and how to track.
    trigger: |
      Largest customer asked about formal referral program after 
      referring third customer. Other customers have asked too.
    actions: |
      1. Analyzed unit economics:
         - Average ACV: $6,000
         - Gross margin: 75% ($4,500)
         - CAC for direct: $1,500
         - LTV: $18,000 (3-year average)
      2. Researched market rates: SaaS referral programs typically 
         10-20% first year, some ongoing.
      3. Designed simple program:
         - 15% of first year revenue ($900 on average deal)
         - Paid as service credit or cash (partner choice)
         - 90-day attribution window
         - No minimum commitment
      4. Created simple one-page referral agreement. Lawyer reviewed.
      5. Set up tracking in spreadsheet:
         - Referrer name and email
         - Referred customer
         - Deal value
         - Payment owed
         - Payment status
      6. Launched to 3 existing referrers. Offered retroactive 
         credit for past referrals (goodwill).
      7. Communicated program to all customers after 30-day pilot.
      8. First quarter: 4 referrals, $3,600 in credits issued. 
         Acquired customers at 60% of direct CAC.
    outcome: |
      Referral program launched successfully. Simple structure easy 
      to explain and track. Service credits reduce cash outlay while 
      partners happy. Channel growing 20% quarter over quarter.
    lessons:
      - Start simple and iterate
      - Service credits can work for early stage
      - Make it easy for referrers
      - Track from day one

    name: "VP BD Building Reseller Channel"
    practitioner: "VP Business Development"
    organization_context: |
      Series B SaaS selling to mid-market. Direct sales working 
      but want to expand through reseller/agency channel. Need to 
      structure reseller economics.
    situation: |
      Approached by several agencies wanting to resell product to 
      their clients. Need to define reseller pricing, margins, and 
      program structure.
    trigger: |
      Three agencies in pipeline want to sign reseller agreements. 
      Need to move fast or lose momentum, but structure needs to 
      be sustainable.
    actions: |
      1. Analyzed reseller economics:
         - Target ACV through reseller: $24,000 (larger than direct)
         - Gross margin: 75%
         - Reseller will handle sales + first-line support
         - Estimated cost savings vs. direct: 20%
      2. Researched market: Agency resellers typically get 25-40% 
         margins, depending on role.
      3. Designed tiered program:
         - Standard reseller: 25% of net revenue
         - Premier reseller (5+ customers/year): 30%
         - Elite reseller (15+ customers/year): 35%
      4. Defined reseller responsibilities:
         - Lead generation and sales
         - Contract negotiation
         - First-line customer support
         - Quarterly business reviews
      5. Our responsibilities:
         - Product and platform
         - Tier 2 support
         - Training and enablement
         - Marketing materials
      6. Built reseller agreement with legal:
         - Clear revenue share terms
         - Customer ownership (we own, they service)
         - Non-exclusivity initially
         - 30-day payment terms after collection
      7. Implemented tracking in Salesforce:
         - Partner-tagged opportunities
         - Monthly revenue reporting
         - Automated payment calculations
      8. Onboarded first 3 resellers with enablement program.
    outcome: |
      Reseller program launched with 3 initial partners. First 
      partner closed 2 customers in 60 days. Unit economics 
      working. Scaling to 10 resellers over next year.
    lessons:
      - Tiered structure rewards performance
      - Clear responsibilities prevent conflict
      - Enablement drives partner success
      - Start with few high-quality partners

    name: "CFO Restructuring Underperforming Partner Program"
    practitioner: "CFO"
    organization_context: |
      Series C company with established partner program. Program 
      has grown but profitability questioned. CFO tasked with 
      reviewing and restructuring.
    situation: |
      Partner program has 50 active partners generating 25% of 
      revenue. However, analysis shows partner revenue less 
      profitable than direct. Some partners barely active.
    trigger: |
      Board asked for partner program ROI analysis during budget 
      review. Analysis revealed concerns about program economics.
    actions: |
      1. Conducted deep analysis of partner economics:
         - Total partner revenue: $5M
         - Partner share paid: $1.2M (24% effective rate)
         - Partner customer retention: 75% (vs. 85% direct)
         - Partner customer expansion: 5% (vs. 15% direct)
      2. Segmented partners by performance:
         - Top 10: 70% of partner revenue, 23% rate
         - Middle 20: 25% of partner revenue, 25% rate
         - Bottom 20: 5% of partner revenue, 24% rate
      3. Identified issues:
         - Flat rate does not reward top performers
         - Bottom performers consuming support with little return
         - No quality incentives in program
      4. Designed restructured program:
         - Base rate: 15% (down from 25%)
         - Performance bonus: +5% if exceed $200K/year
         - Quality bonus: +5% if customer retention over 80%
         - Maximum: 25% (same as before for top performers)
      5. Modeled impact:
         - Top partners: Similar earnings (motivated to perform)
         - Middle partners: Reduced unless they improve
         - Bottom partners: Significantly reduced
      6. Communicated changes to partner base:
         - 90-day notice (per agreement)
         - Individual calls with top 10 partners
         - Email to remainder with FAQ
      7. Expected outcomes:
         - Bottom 20 partners: 10 will leave, 10 will try harder
         - Middle partners: Some will step up
         - Top partners: Engaged by quality incentive
      8. Results after 6 months:
         - Active partners: 40 (vs. 50)
         - Partner revenue: $4.5M (10% decline)
         - Partner share: $800K (33% decline)
         - Net margin improvement: $300K annually
    outcome: |
      Partner program restructured with performance-based economics. 
      Lost low performers but retained and motivated top partners. 
      Improved program profitability by $300K annually while 
      maintaining most revenue.
    lessons:
      - Measure partner program economics regularly
      - Flat rates create mediocrity
      - Performance incentives work
      - Be willing to let poor partners leave

operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - Partnership relationships generating revenue
    - Unit economics understanding
    - Tracking capability
    - Payment processing ability
    
  common_blockers:
    - "Cannot track attribution - Implement basic tracking first"
    - "Rate disagreement - Model economics for both sides"
    - "Payment delays - Automate and systematize"
    - "Disputes - Clear attribution rules upfront"
    
  integration_points:
    - Sales: Customer acquisition tracking
    - Finance: Payment processing, accounting
    - Legal: Agreement documentation
    - Product: Integration/partner attribution

risks:
  if_skipped: |
    Partners not motivated. Informal arrangements create confusion. 
    No data on partner channel economics. Disputes damage relationships.
    
  if_over_engineered: |
    Complex structures confuse partners. Tracking overhead exceeds 
    value. Analysis paralysis on rate setting. Partners go elsewhere.
