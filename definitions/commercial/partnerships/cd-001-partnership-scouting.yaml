definition:
  purpose: |
    Partnerships can accelerate growth - distribution, credibility, product 
    enhancement - but most partnership conversations waste time. The difference 
    between productive partnerships and partnership theater is systematic scouting: 
    knowing WHO to approach, WHY they'd partner, and WHAT you're actually offering.
    
    Partnership scouting is the top-of-funnel for BD. It answers: "Who should we 
    talk to, and why would they care?" Without scouting, you waste time on 
    conversations that were never going to close. With good scouting, every 
    conversation has a real chance of value creation.
    
    Common failure modes:
    - Spray and pray (pitch everyone, convert no one)
    - Partner logo collecting (announced, never activated)
    - Mutual masturbation (meet often, do nothing)
    - Asymmetric value (you need them, they don't need you)
    
  outcome: |
    A prioritized list of partnership targets with clear rationale for each.
    Initial conversations convert to deeper exploration at >30% rate.
    Partnerships pursued are realistic and mutually valuable.

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "First BD hire doesn't know where to start"
    practitioner: "Head of Business Development"
    organization_context: "20-person Series A, just hired first BD person, no partnership infrastructure"
    situation: |
      Alex (new BD hire) joined to "build partnerships." The founders have done 
      ad-hoc partner conversations but nothing systematic. There's a vague sense 
      that "we should partner with more companies" but no strategy for who or why. 
      Alex has a quota to "close 5 partnerships in 6 months" but no target list, 
      no materials, and no clarity on what a "partnership" even means.
    trigger: "New BD hire, unclear mandate, need to build from scratch"
    actions: |
      1. Alex starts by interviewing the founders: "What do we need from partnerships?"
         - Distribution: access to more customers (high priority)
         - Credibility: "who we work with" signaling (medium priority)
         - Product: integrations that make product stickier (medium priority)
      2. Asks: "Who have we already talked to?"
         - Found 15 scattered partner conversations in Slack, email, nowhere centralized
         - 3 had potential, 12 were dead ends
         - No notes on why conversations died
      3. Maps the landscape: creates spreadsheet with categories:
         - Adjacent products (complementary SaaS) - 25 companies
         - Platforms (where customers live) - 10 companies
         - Agencies (who advises customers) - 15 agencies
         - Industry leaders (credibility) - 5 companies
      4. Develops scorecard with founders. Realizes: "We say 'partnership' but 
         mean different things." Aligns on: integration partnerships for product, 
         referral partnerships for distribution.
      5. Scores top 50 partners. Top 10: all are platforms or adjacent products 
         with clear integration potential. Gets intros from investors for 6 of 10.
      6. Creates pitch: "We help your users [outcome]. Here's how [specific]. 
         Interested in exploring an integration?"
      7. First 3 months: 8 meetings from outreach, 3 advance to technical 
         discussion, 1 integration launched.
    outcome: |
      By month 6: 3 integration partnerships live, 2 referral partnerships active. 
      Pipeline of 15 more in conversation. Key learning: the scorecard forced 
      prioritization - without it, would have chased everyone.
    lessons:
      - "Start by understanding what company actually needs from partnerships"
      - "Audit existing partner conversations before starting new"
      - "Build the landscape before scoring - need to see the whole board"
      - "Scorecard forces prioritization and alignment"
      - "Investor intros significantly improve response rate"
      - "Define 'partnership' specifically - too vague otherwise"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Scouting a platform partnership"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: "12-person startup, wants to build on a major platform (Salesforce/HubSpot/Shopify type), never done this before"
    situation: |
      Maya (CEO) runs a marketing tool. She wants to be in the HubSpot ecosystem - 
      their customers are her customers, and an integration would drive distribution. 
      But HubSpot has 1,000+ app partners. She doesn't know anyone there. She's not 
      sure if HubSpot would even take a meeting, or what she'd ask for if they did.
    trigger: "Strategic decision to pursue platform partnership, no access or experience"
    actions: |
      1. Maya researches how HubSpot's partner ecosystem works:
         - App marketplace (anyone can list with approved integration)
         - Partner tiers (starter, silver, gold, platinum based on co-sell)
         - Partner programs (agency, solutions, app partners - different)
         She realizes: she doesn't need a "meeting with HubSpot" - she needs to 
         build an integration and get listed.
      2. Finds the self-serve path:
         - Join app partner program (free)
         - Build integration (their API, her dev time)
         - Get listed on marketplace (review process)
         - Then: HubSpot only cares if she drives volume
      3. Talks to 3 companies already in HubSpot ecosystem:
         - "Listing is easy, traction is hard"
         - "Focus on mutual customers who'd use both"
         - "HubSpot BD only talks to you if you have traction"
      4. Identifies 10 mutual customers (use her product + HubSpot). Asks them:
         - "Would you use this integration?" 7 say yes.
         - "Would you pay more for integrated version?" 4 say yes.
         This becomes her business case.
      5. Builds MVP integration (2 weeks dev time). Lists in marketplace with 
         strong copy focused on HubSpot user pain points.
      6. Gets first 20 installs organically. Writes case study with happy customer.
      7. NOW reaches out to HubSpot partnership team with proof: "We have 20 
         active users, here's a case study, here's our growth plan. How do we 
         become a recommended partner?"
    outcome: |
      6 months later: 200 installs, featured in HubSpot newsletter, invited to 
      partner event. Key learning: platform partnerships are earned with traction, 
      not asked for in meetings.
    lessons:
      - "Platform partnerships often don't need 'permission' - build first"
      - "Study the ecosystem structure before approaching"
      - "Talk to companies already in the ecosystem - they'll share honestly"
      - "Validate with mutual customers before building"
      - "Traction gets you the meeting - not the other way around"
      - "Platform BD cares about volume you drive, not your pitch"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Wasting 6 months on a partnership that wasn't real"
    practitioner: "VP of Partnerships"
    organization_context: "45-person Series B, spent 6 months on partnership that never activated, post-mortem"
    situation: |
      Jake (VP Partnerships) just ended a 6-month partnership pursuit that went 
      nowhere. The partner (Fortune 500 company) had multiple meetings, internal 
      champions, exciting conversations about "transformational partnership." 
      But it never activated - legal delays, priority shifts, champion left. 
      Jake wasted 6 months and needs to prevent this from happening again.
    trigger: "Post-mortem on failed partnership pursuit, need better qualification"
    actions: |
      1. Jake runs post-mortem: what went wrong?
         - Signals were there from the start:
           - No executive sponsor (just mid-level champion)
           - Couldn't define first concrete project
           - "Legal review" took 3 months (they weren't prioritizing)
           - Champion had no budget or decision authority
      2. Creates "partnership red flags" checklist:
         - No executive sponsor → Warning
         - Can't define Phase 1 concretely → Warning
         - Internal champion not empowered → Warning
         - No budget identified → Warning
         - Legal/security as blocker for months → Walk away
         - "Check back next quarter" repeatedly → Walk away
      3. Adds qualification gates to partnership process:
         - Gate 1 (after first meeting): Is there mutual value articulated?
         - Gate 2 (after 3 meetings): Is there executive sponsor?
         - Gate 3 (before major effort): Is Phase 1 defined with timeline and owner?
         If any gate fails, deprioritize or walk away.
      4. Changes outreach approach: "We're exploring a small pilot to [specific]. 
         Would you have 30 minutes to see if it makes sense?" Smaller ask, faster 
         qualification.
      5. Implements "time limit" rule: if no material progress in 60 days, 
         explicitly pause and evaluate whether to continue.
      6. Tests with next partnership: large fintech wants to explore. After 2 
         meetings, no executive sponsor identified. Jake raises this directly: 
         "We'd love to continue, but we need to know this has leadership support. 
         Can you arrange an intro?" They couldn't. Jake walked away politely. 
         Saved 4 months of wasted effort.
    outcome: |
      Next 6 months: 2 partnerships closed instead of 0, both with clear 
      qualification upfront. Average time from first meeting to decision: 45 days 
      (down from 90+). Key learning: qualification is about respecting everyone's 
      time, not being negative.
    lessons:
      - "Partnerships fail in qualification, not execution - qualify harder"
      - "Executive sponsor is non-negotiable - no sponsor, no deal"
      - "If you can't define Phase 1, the partnership isn't real"
      - "'Legal is reviewing' for months means you're not a priority"
      - "Time limits force decisions - set them and stick to them"
      - "Walking away from bad partnerships is as valuable as closing good ones"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Spray and pray - too many conversations, no depth"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Score and prioritize ruthlessly. Focus on top 10-20, go deep. Better to 
        have 5 meaningful conversations than 50 superficial ones. Track time 
        spent per partner to prevent spreading too thin.
        
    - risk: "No response to outreach"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Lead with THEIR value, not yours. Get warm intros whenever possible.
        Be specific about what you're proposing. Follow up 3x before giving up.
        Test different channels (LinkedIn, email, intro).
        
    - risk: "Conversations that go nowhere"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Qualify harder upfront. Require executive sponsor, concrete Phase 1,
        timeline with accountability. Set time limits - 60 days to material 
        progress or deprioritize. Ask directly: "Is this a priority for you?"
        
    - risk: "Partner says yes but doesn't execute"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Define success before announcing. Require commitments, not enthusiasm.
        Start with small pilot before big commitment. Monthly check-ins with 
        clear metrics. Don't PR the partnership until it's activated.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Partnership time displaces sales/product time"
      impact: |
        BD becomes distraction from core business. Team stretched across 
        partnerships that don't pay off. Direct sales suffers. Opportunity 
        cost of engineering on integrations vs. core product.
      prevention: |
        Clear partnership strategy with ROI criteria. Time limits on BD 
        activities. Regular assessment: "Is this working? Should we continue?"
        Partnerships should accelerate business, not complicate it.
        
    - risk: "Partner logo collecting without substance"
      impact: |
        Announce partnerships that don't activate. Credibility loss when 
        customers ask "but what does the partnership DO?" Team cynicism 
        about BD function. Investor skepticism about traction claims.
      prevention: |
        Never announce until activated. Define activation criteria before 
        launch. Track partner-sourced outcomes, not just partner count.
        Quality > quantity.
