definition:
  purpose: |
    Co-branding brings two or more brands together in ways that 
    benefit all parties. Effective co-branding extends reach, 
    borrows credibility, and creates unique value for customers.
    
    Common co-branding scenarios:
    
    1. Logo/endorsement: Partner logos on websites, materials, 
       products (e.g., "Powered by" or "Integrated with").
    
    2. Content collaboration: Joint whitepapers, webinars, case 
       studies, or thought leadership.
    
    3. Event partnership: Co-sponsored events, trade shows, 
       conferences, or workshops.
    
    4. Campaign collaboration: Joint marketing campaigns, 
       promotions, or product launches.
    
    5. Product integration: Co-branded features, integrations, 
       or bundled offerings.
    
    Why co-branding matters for startups:
    
    1. Credibility transfer. Association with established brands 
       signals quality and trust.
    
    2. Audience expansion. Reach partner's audience you could 
       not access alone.
    
    3. Resource efficiency. Share marketing costs and effort 
       with partners.
    
    4. Differentiation. Unique partnerships differentiate from 
       competitors.
    
    5. Relationship deepening. Co-branding strengthens partner 
       commitment.
    
  outcome: |
    Co-branding initiatives that extend reach and credibility. 
    Clear guidelines that protect brand while enabling collaboration. 
    Measurable results from co-marketing efforts. Stronger partner 
    relationships through successful joint activities.
