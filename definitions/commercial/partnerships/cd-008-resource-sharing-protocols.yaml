definition:
  purpose: |
    Resource sharing protocols define how partners share capabilities, 
    assets, or infrastructure to mutual benefit. Well-designed 
    sharing arrangements reduce costs, expand capabilities, and 
    strengthen partnerships.
    
    Common resource sharing scenarios:
    
    1. Technology sharing: Partners share platforms, tools, or 
       infrastructure (e.g., shared data platform, joint development 
       environment).
    
    2. Personnel sharing: Partners share specialized talent (e.g., 
       shared data scientist, joint engineering team).
    
    3. Facilities sharing: Partners share physical spaces (e.g., 
       shared office, lab, or manufacturing capacity).
    
    4. Go-to-market sharing: Partners share sales, marketing, or 
       distribution resources (e.g., joint trade show presence, 
       shared sales team).
    
    5. Knowledge sharing: Partners share expertise, processes, or 
       intellectual property (e.g., joint training, shared best 
       practices).
    
    Why resource sharing protocols matter:
    
    1. Reduce costs. Sharing resources lowers cost for all parties.
    
    2. Access capabilities. Gain access to resources you cannot 
       afford or build alone.
    
    3. Strengthen partnerships. Shared resources create 
       interdependence and trust.
    
    4. Prevent conflicts. Clear protocols prevent disputes about 
       usage, costs, and ownership.
    
  outcome: |
    Clear agreements on what is shared, how it is used, and how 
    costs are allocated. Protocols that prevent conflicts and 
    ensure fair value exchange. Stronger partnerships through 
    successful resource collaboration.

    name: "Startup Sharing Cloud Infrastructure with Partner"
    practitioner: "CTO / Co-founder"
    organization_context: |
      Seed-stage startup building data analytics product. Close 
      partnership with complementary startup. Both have high 
      cloud costs relative to revenue.
    situation: |
      Both companies use AWS and have significant cloud spend. 
      Partner has better infrastructure automation. We have 
      excess data pipeline capacity. Opportunity to share and 
      reduce costs for both.
    trigger: |
      Partner CTO mentioned their cloud bill during casual 
      conversation. Realized we could help each other.
    actions: |
      1. Met with partner CTO to explore sharing:
         - We have data pipeline capacity (can process 5x current)
         - They have sophisticated deployment automation
         - Both have high fixed cloud costs
      2. Identified sharing opportunity:
         - Share our data pipeline - they use excess capacity
         - They share deployment automation - we use it
         - Pool AWS spend for better volume discounts
      3. Defined scope:
         - Data pipeline: 40 hours/week capacity for partner
         - Deployment automation: Full access for our team
         - AWS: Joint enterprise discount negotiation
      4. Established simple cost model:
         - Reciprocal exchange - no money for pipeline/automation
         - AWS savings split 50/50
         - Tracked usage but no payment unless imbalanced
      5. Created operating protocol:
         - Weekly sync between engineering leads
         - Shared Slack channel for issues
         - Quarterly review of balance
      6. Documented in simple MOU (2 pages). Legal light-touch 
         review.
      7. Launched sharing arrangement. First month smooth. 
         AWS savings of $3K/month each from pooled volume.
    outcome: |
      Resource sharing working well. Both companies saving money. 
      Partnership strengthened through operational collaboration. 
      Discussing additional sharing opportunities.
    lessons:
      - Start with trusted partners
      - Reciprocal can work if balanced
      - Simple protocols for simple sharing
      - Win-win creates strong relationships

    name: "VP Operations Structuring Multi-Party Lab Sharing"
    practitioner: "VP Operations"
    organization_context: |
      Series B biotech company. Expensive lab facility with 
      specialized equipment. Usage variable - sometimes full, 
      sometimes underutilized.
    situation: |
      Lab facility costs $50K/month. Usage averages 60% - 
      significant underutilization. Two other biotechs in network 
      have expressed interest in occasional lab access.
    trigger: |
      Board pressed on facility efficiency. CFO asked Operations 
      to find ways to better utilize or offset lab costs.
    actions: |
      1. Analyzed lab utilization:
         - Current usage: 60% average
         - Peak usage: 85% (occasional)
         - Available for sharing: 20% safely
      2. Talked to interested companies:
         - Company A: Needs 10% capacity, occasional burst
         - Company B: Needs 5% capacity, regular weekly
         - Both willing to pay for access
      3. Designed sharing model:
         - Available capacity: 20% of lab hours
         - Booking: 72-hour advance, our work prioritized
         - Pricing: $400/day for standard access
         - Equipment: Included, consumables separate
      4. Established protocols:
         - Safety training required
         - Equipment certification
         - Booking system (simple calendar)
         - Lab manager coordination
      5. Created cost allocation:
         - Fixed monthly fee: $2K for 5 days guaranteed
         - Variable: $400/day for additional days
         - Cancellation: 24-hour notice or charged
      6. Built agreement with legal:
         - Liability and insurance
         - IP protection
         - Confidentiality
         - Safety requirements
      7. Set up governance:
         - Lab manager handles day-to-day
         - Monthly check-in with partners
         - Quarterly review of arrangement
      8. Launched with Company A. Company B joined 3 months 
         later after seeing success.
    outcome: |
      Lab sharing generating $5K-7K/month in revenue. Effective 
      utilization up to 80%. Covering 10-15% of facility costs. 
      Strengthened relationships with partner companies.
    lessons:
      - Underutilized resources are sharing opportunities
      - Start with one partner before scaling
      - Clear protocols prevent operational issues
      - Keep enough buffer for own needs

    name: "CEO Managing Failed Resource Sharing Arrangement"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: |
      Series A company that entered resource sharing arrangement 
      with larger partner. Sharing of engineering resources and 
      office space. Arrangement has become problematic.
    situation: |
      6 months ago agreed to share office space and engineering 
      resources with larger partner. They have become demanding, 
      our engineers frustrated, office conflicts emerging.
    trigger: |
      Engineering lead escalated concerns about partner demands. 
      Two engineers considering leaving due to frustration. Need 
      to address or exit arrangement.
    actions: |

         - Partner treating shared engineers as their team
         - Priority conflicts (their "urgent" displacing our work)
         - Office space being used beyond agreement
         - No mechanism for addressing issues
      2. Reviewed original agreement:
         - Scope was vague ("engineering collaboration")
         - No governance or escalation defined
         - No limits on requests
         - No exit terms specified
      3. Attempted to fix with partner:
         - Met with partner CEO
         - Explained concerns
         - Partner pushed back, felt arrangement was working
      4. Assessed options:
         - Renegotiate with clearer terms
         - Scale back significantly
         - Exit arrangement entirely
      5. Decided to exit:
         - Relationship too damaged to fix
         - Terms too vague to enforce
         - Risk to team morale too high
      6. Executed exit:
         - Sent written notice (60 days per informal agreement)
         - Transitioned ongoing work
         - Separated office space usage
         - Preserved professional relationship
      7. Documented lessons:
         - Wrote up what went wrong
         - Created template for future arrangements
         - Shared learning with team
    outcome: |
      Exited resource sharing arrangement. Team morale improved. 
      Professional relationship with partner preserved (barely). 
      Created better processes for future sharing arrangements.
    lessons:
      - Vague agreements cause problems
      - Governance and limits essential
      - Address issues early before they grow
      - Exit gracefully when arrangement fails
