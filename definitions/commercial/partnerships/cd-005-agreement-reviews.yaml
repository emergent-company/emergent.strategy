definition:
  purpose: |
    Agreement reviews ensure that commercial contracts protect company 
    interests, allocate risk appropriately, and enable rather than 
    block business. Every agreement you sign creates obligations - 
    some obvious, some hidden - that can affect the company for years.
    
    Why systematic agreement review matters:
    
    1. Contracts are asymmetric. The other party drafted the agreement 
       with their interests in mind. Default terms favor them.
    
    2. Risks compound. One bad indemnification clause across many 
       customer contracts creates massive aggregate exposure.
    
    3. Time is the enemy. Deals arrive with urgency. Without a 
       systematic process, either deals slow down or risks get missed.
    
    4. Institutional memory. When the person who negotiated leaves, 
       you need to understand what was agreed and why.
    
    Agreement types requiring review:
    - Customer contracts (SaaS, enterprise, pilot)
    - Vendor and supplier agreements
    - Partnership and reseller agreements
    - Employment and contractor agreements
    - Investor documents (term sheets, SHAs, SAFE/convertibles)
    - Real estate (office leases)
    - IP and licensing agreements
    - NDAs (counterparty paper)
    
  outcome: |
    Contracts that protect company interests while enabling business 
    velocity. Clear understanding of obligations and risks. Consistent 
    positions across similar deals. Audit-ready contract repository.

    name: "Founder Reviewing First Enterprise Contract"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      Seed-stage startup, 8 people. First enterprise deal ($150K ACV) 
      arrived. Customer sent their standard procurement agreement. 
      Founder has never negotiated enterprise contract.
    situation: |
      Customer sent 40-page Master Services Agreement with their standard 
      terms. Deal needs to close in 3 weeks. Founder overwhelmed by 
      legal language and concerned about risk.
    trigger: |
      Sales champion at customer sent contract with note saying 
      procurement needs signed agreement to process purchase order.
    actions: |
      1. First reaction was panic at document length. Took deep breath 
         and started systematically.
      2. Skimmed entire document to understand structure. Identified 
         key sections: Commercial Terms, Liability, IP, Data, Termination.
      3. Focused on sections with highest risk:
         - Found unlimited indemnification for any breach
         - Found 60-day termination for convenience by customer
         - Found broad IP license grant
         - Found security audit rights with 24-hour notice
      4. Engaged lawyer for 2-hour review. Lawyer flagged same issues 
         plus governing law (unfamiliar jurisdiction) and audit scope.
      5. Created issues list with three categories:
         - Must change: Unlimited indemnification, broad IP grant
         - Should change: Termination notice period, audit rights
         - Accept: Payment terms, governing law
      6. Drafted redlines with explanations. Sent to customer champion 
         with note explaining these are standard positions for SaaS 
         vendors.
      7. Customer pushed back on indemnification. Compromised on 12x 
         monthly fees cap with carve-out for IP and data breach 
         (uncapped for those).
      8. Negotiation took 2 weeks of back and forth. CEO stayed 
         involved but let lawyer handle technical drafting.
      9. Final agreement signed. Filed in Drive with summary of key 
         terms negotiated.
    outcome: |
      First enterprise deal closed with acceptable terms. Liability 
      capped appropriately. IP protected. Process took longer than 
      expected but created template for future deals.
    lessons:
      - Enterprise contracts require real review
      - Focus on material terms not every clause
      - Lawyer helps but you must understand the deal
      - Document what was negotiated for future reference

    name: "VP Sales Scaling Contract Review"
    practitioner: "VP Sales"
    organization_context: |
      Series A company, 40 people, moving upmarket. Volume of contracts 
      increasing. CEO previously reviewed all contracts but cannot 
      keep up. Need to scale process without adding legal headcount.
    situation: |
      Contract review becoming bottleneck. Deals waiting days for CEO 
      review. Some deals using customer paper without review. Reps 
      frustrated with delays.
    trigger: |
      Lost deal because contract review took 2 weeks and customer 
      went with competitor who moved faster.
    actions: |
      1. Analyzed contract volume: 15-20 agreements/month. Breakdown: 
         60% standard SMB, 30% mid-market, 10% enterprise.
      2. Created contract playbook:
         - Standard positions for top 10 issues
         - Fallback positions for each
         - Redlines we will not accept
         - Examples and language
      3. Built tiered process:
         - Tier 1 (our paper, under $50K): Self-service, rep signs
         - Tier 2 (minor changes, $50-200K): Manager review
         - Tier 3 (customer paper or over $200K): VP Sales + lawyer
         - Tier 4 (exceptions): VP Sales + lawyer + CEO
      4. Created review checklist for reps to self-assess:
         - 10 yes/no questions
         - Any no triggers escalation
         - Takes 5 minutes
      5. Trained sales team on playbook. Role-played common 
         negotiations. Built confidence to handle Tier 1/2.
      6. Set up contract tracker in Salesforce:
         - Stage (review, negotiation, approval, signature)
         - Issues list
         - Owner and escalation
         - Target close date
      7. Established SLAs: Tier 1 same day, Tier 2 2 days, Tier 3 
         5 days, Tier 4 negotiated.
      8. Monthly review of what is getting escalated. Identified 
         patterns, updated playbook, improved training.
    outcome: |
      Contract review time reduced 60%. CEO involvement reduced 80%. 
      Reps empowered to handle standard deals. Consistent terms 
      across deals. Lost fewer deals to speed.
    lessons:
      - Process scales, people do not
      - Tiered approach enables velocity
      - Playbooks create consistency
      - Training reps pays off

    name: "Legal Counsel Managing Partner Agreement"
    practitioner: "General Counsel"
    organization_context: |
      Series B company with in-house legal. Negotiating strategic 
      partnership with major enterprise software vendor. High-value, 
      complex agreement with significant ongoing obligations.
    situation: |
      Partner sent 80-page partnership agreement with extensive terms. 
      Partnership is strategically important but terms are heavily 
      one-sided. BD team wants to sign quickly.
    trigger: |
      VP BD asked for quick turnaround on partnership agreement. 
      GC reviewed and found multiple material concerns.
    actions: |
      1. Conducted thorough review (8 hours). Created 5-page analysis 
         of key issues:
         - Exclusivity provisions broader than discussed
         - Revenue share below market (15% vs. typical 25-30%)
         - IP assignment of joint development to partner
         - Termination only for cause, 12-month notice
         - Non-compete restricting our market activity
      2. Met with BD lead to understand priorities. BD felt:
         - Revenue share negotiable, expected pushback
         - Exclusivity was discussed, thought it was narrower
         - Did not realize IP implications
         - Need partnership, willing to accept some risk
      3. Created negotiation strategy:
         - Must win: Narrow exclusivity, reasonable IP terms
         - Important: Better revenue share, termination flexibility
         - Tradeable: Support obligations, marketing commitments
         - Redline: No full IP assignment, no broad non-compete
      4. Drafted comprehensive redline with 40+ changes. Organized 
         by priority and impact.
      5. Prepared negotiation summary for partner:
         - Top 5 issues requiring resolution
         - Proposed alternatives for each
         - Business justification
      6. Led 3 negotiation calls with partner legal. CEO joined 
         for commercial terms call.
      7. Negotiated for 6 weeks. Key outcomes:
         - Exclusivity narrowed to specific use case
         - Revenue share improved to 22%
         - IP remains with creator, license granted
         - Mutual termination for convenience with 90 days
         - Non-compete removed
      8. Obtained board approval for strategic partnership.
      9. Executed agreement, created summary for ongoing management.
    outcome: |
      Partnership signed with materially improved terms. Protected 
      IP and market freedom. Established good precedent for partner 
      agreements. GC built credibility as business enabler.
    lessons:
      - Complex agreements require thorough review
      - Align with business on priorities before negotiating
      - Be creative with solutions not just positions
      - Document for ongoing management

operational_context:
  prerequisites:

    - Deal context and business justification
    - Contract playbook or positions
    - Legal support access (internal or external)
    
  common_blockers:
    - "Deal team wants to skip review - Enforce process, highlight risk"
    - "Counterparty will not negotiate - Know your walkaway point"
    - "No legal support - Build playbook, use external counsel strategically"
    - "Review takes too long - Tier process, self-service for standard"
    
  integration_points:
    - Sales: Customer agreements
    - BD: Partnership agreements
    - Finance: Vendor agreements, payment terms
    - HR: Employment agreements
    - Procurement: Supplier agreements

risks:
  if_skipped: |
    Sign agreements with hidden risks. Inconsistent terms across 
    deals. Aggregate liability exposure. Audit and compliance 
    failures. Lost institutional memory.
    
  if_over_engineered: |
    Deals slow down, lost to faster competitors. Legal becomes 
    blocker instead of enabler. Over-negotiation damages 
    relationships. Excessive cost for low-risk deals.
