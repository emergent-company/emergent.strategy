definition:
  purpose: |
    A joint venture (JV) is a strategic arrangement where two or more 
    parties collaborate on a specific initiative while remaining 
    independent organizations. JVs range from informal collaborations 
    to formal entities with dedicated resources and governance.
    
    When joint ventures make sense:
    
    1. Combining complementary capabilities. You have technology, 
       they have distribution. Together you can do what neither could alone.
    
    2. Sharing risk and capital. Large initiatives requiring investment 
       neither party wants to make alone.
    
    3. Market entry. Local partner provides market access, regulatory 
       knowledge, customer relationships.
    
    4. Co-development. Creating something new that requires expertise 
       from multiple parties.
    
    When joint ventures are risky:
    
    1. Misaligned incentives. Partners have different timelines, 
       risk appetites, or definitions of success.
    
    2. Governance complexity. Decision-making across organizations 
       creates friction and slowness.
    
    3. Exit complications. Getting out of a JV can be expensive and 
       contentious.
    
    4. Distraction. JVs consume management attention away from core 
       business.
    
    Joint venture structures:
    - Contractual JV: Collaboration agreement without separate entity
    - Equity JV: New legal entity with shared ownership
    - Strategic partnership: Deep collaboration short of formal JV
    
  outcome: |
    Successful joint ventures that create value neither party could 
    achieve alone. Clear governance and decision rights. Aligned 
    incentives. Clean exit paths. Protected core business interests.

    name: "First-Time JV for Market Entry"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      Series B SaaS company based in US. Significant interest from 
      European customers but no presence or expertise. Approached 
      by European company about potential collaboration.
    situation: |
      European partner approached with JV idea: they have customer 
      relationships and local expertise, we have the product. Want 
      to create joint entity for European market.
    trigger: |
      Partner CEO raised JV concept during conference meeting. 
      Followed up with formal proposal for joint market entry.
    actions: |
      1. Assessed opportunity: European market is $500M, growing 30%. 
         We have no presence, would take 2-3 years to build alone.
      2. Assessed partner: Strong regional presence, 50 enterprise 
         customers in our target segment, good reputation. Spoke 
         with 3 companies who work with them.
      3. Evaluated alternatives:
         - Build alone: 2-3 years, $3M investment, high risk
         - Acquire partner: Too expensive, they are not selling
         - Channel partnership: They want more than referral fees
         - JV: Shared risk, faster entry, aligned incentives
      4. Decided JV worth exploring. Defined our objectives:
         - Access to European market
         - Retain product IP
         - Exit option if does not work
         - Not distract from US business
      5. Negotiated term sheet over 6 weeks:
         - 50/50 equity JV
         - We contribute product license, they contribute team/relationships
         - Board with 2 from each side
         - We appoint CEO, they appoint COO
         - 3-year commitment, buy/sell after
      6. Legal documentation took 10 weeks. Key negotiation:
         - IP: We retain, license to JV
         - Non-compete: Narrow to specific European segment
         - Exit: Either can trigger buy/sell after Year 3
      7. Launched JV. Invested heavily in first 90 days:
         - CEO spent 1 week/month in Europe
         - Weekly calls with partner CEO
         - Joint customer events
      8. Year 1: 15 customers, $1M ARR. Relationship healthy.
    outcome: |
      JV achieved European entry in 12 months vs. 3 years alone. 
      Partner proved capable and aligned. Relationship required 
      significant management attention but worth it. Considering 
      expansion of scope.
    lessons:
      - JVs require significant CEO time
      - Partner selection is critical
      - Clear IP boundaries essential
      - Over-invest in relationship early

    name: "Restructuring Troubled JV"
    practitioner: "VP Business Development"
    organization_context: |
      Series C company with 2-year-old JV for co-development project. 
      JV underperforming, relationship strained, both parties 
      frustrated but invested.
    situation: |
      JV missed targets for second consecutive year. Technology 
      integration harder than expected. Team morale low. Partners 
      blame each other. Board meetings contentious.
    trigger: |
      JV CEO resigned. Both parent CEOs agreed something needs to 
      change. VP BD tasked with recommending path forward.
    actions: |
      1. Conducted assessment:
         - Reviewed performance data: 40% of revenue target
         - Interviewed JV team: Cited unclear direction, parent friction
         - Interviewed both parent teams: Blamed each other
         - Analyzed root causes: Integration harder than expected, 
           governance unclear, resource commitment inconsistent
      2. Evaluated options:
         - Status quo: Continuing to fail
         - Double down: More resources, new leadership
         - Restructure: Narrow scope, clearer governance
         - Wind down: Cut losses, salvage what we can
      3. Recommended restructure based on:
         - Underlying opportunity still valid
         - Core technology working, integration issues fixable
         - Both parties still want success
         - Wind down would write off significant investment
      4. Facilitated restructuring discussion with partner:
         - Both CEOs acknowledged shared responsibility
         - Agreed narrow scope to proven use case
         - Restructured governance (operating committee with clear authority)
         - Committed specific resources from each side
      5. Amended JV agreement:
         - Reduced scope and budget
         - New performance milestones
         - Clearer decision rights
         - Exit trigger if Year 3 misses
      6. Recruited strong JV GM with turnaround experience.
      7. Implemented monthly operating reviews with both sponsors.
      8. Year 1 post-restructure: Hit 80% of reduced targets. 
         Relationship improved. Path to viability visible.
    outcome: |
      JV saved through restructure. Narrower scope more achievable. 
      Improved governance reduced friction. Not yet successful but 
      on better track. Key learning applied to future partnerships.
    lessons:
      - Address issues before crisis
      - Both parties must own problems
      - Sometimes scope reduction is right answer
      - Clear governance prevents friction

    name: "Exiting JV Successfully"
    practitioner: "CFO"
    organization_context: |
      Multi-stage company with successful 5-year JV. JV achieved 
      objectives. Time to evaluate next phase. Partner has different 
      vision for JV future.
    situation: |
      JV exceeded targets, built $20M business. Original 5-year 
      term approaching. Partner wants to expand scope significantly. 
      We prefer to focus resources elsewhere. Need clean exit.
    trigger: |
      JV board meeting 6 months before term end. Partner proposed 
      major expansion. We indicated interest in exploring options.
    actions: |
      1. Reviewed agreement: Buy/sell mechanism available, triggered 
         by either party post-term. Valuation based on formula.
      2. Assessed our options:
         - Expand with partner: Would require $10M+ investment
         - Maintain status quo: Partner not interested
         - Buy partner out: Would need to run JV, not core to us
         - Sell to partner: Clean exit, fair value
      3. Determined sell to partner was preferred:
         - Aligned with our strategy (focus elsewhere)
         - Partner wants to continue
         - Clean exit with value capture
      4. Engaged advisor to support valuation and negotiation.
      5. Initiated buy/sell process per agreement:
         - Notified partner of interest in exit
         - Proposed sale at formula price
         - Partner counter-offered 15% below
      6. Negotiated for 8 weeks:
         - Final price 8% below formula (fair given their continued operation)
         - Clean IP license conversion (perpetual for JV field)
         - Transition services for 6 months
         - Non-compete narrowed
      7. Executed sale:
         - Partner acquired our 50%
         - Received $18M (good return on contribution)
         - Transition completed smoothly
      8. Maintained relationship with former partner (now customer).
    outcome: |
      Clean exit from successful JV at fair value. Protected IP 
      for our core business. Maintained relationship. Freed up 
      management attention. Exit executed in 4 months.
    lessons:
      - Success does not mean continue forever
      - Exit mechanisms matter - design carefully
      - Partner may be best buyer
      - Exit professionally to preserve relationship

operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - Strategic opportunity requiring collaboration
    - Identified potential partner
    - Resources to contribute to JV
    - Management bandwidth for JV oversight
    
  common_blockers:
    - "Cannot agree on terms - May not be right partners"
    - "Governance too complex - Simplify structure"
    - "JV distracting from core - Ensure clear boundaries"
    - "Partner not committed - Address early or exit"
    
  integration_points:
    - Strategy: JV alignment with overall direction
    - Legal: JV structuring and documentation
    - Finance: JV economics and accounting
    - Operations: JV execution and support
    - BD: Partner relationship and negotiation

risks:
  if_skipped: |
    Miss opportunities requiring collaboration. Attempt informal 
    arrangements that create liability. Fail to structure 
    appropriately and create problems later.
    
  if_over_engineered: |
    JV complexity kills deal. Governance overhead exceeds value. 
    Spend more time on structure than execution. Create inflexible 
    arrangement.
