definition:
  purpose: |
    Your brand assets are the building blocks everyone uses to represent your 
    company. When they're scattered across Dropbox folders, email attachments, 
    and outdated websites, people grab whatever they can find—often the wrong 
    version. This creates inconsistent brand representation that accumulates 
    into a fragmented brand image.
    
    Proper asset management isn't about bureaucracy. It's about making it 
    faster and easier to do the right thing. When someone needs your logo, 
    they should find it in 10 seconds in the exact format they need. When 
    they find it, it should be the current version.
    
    For early-stage companies, this starts simple: one folder, clearly organized, 
    with all current assets. As you grow—adding agencies, partners, and 
    departments—the system scales with you. But the principle remains: make 
    correct assets easier to find than incorrect ones.
    
    The cost of poor asset management shows up in wasted time (hunting for 
    files), inconsistent brand (wrong versions used), and rework (fixing 
    materials that used outdated assets).
    
  outcome: |
    Anyone needing brand assets finds the correct version in under 30 seconds. 
    Old versions don't circulate. External partners access approved assets 
    without emailing for files. Time spent hunting for assets drops to near zero.

      best_practices:
        - Search everywhere—email, Dropbox, Google Drive, Slack, downloads
        - Note duplicates and variants
        - Identify current vs. outdated versions
        - Flag assets without source files
      avoid:
        - Assuming you know where everything is
        - Stopping at obvious locations (assets hide in unexpected places)
        
    - step: 2

        - "Version comparison document"
        - "Approval sign-off form"
      best_practices:
        - Get designer/agency confirmation on correct versions
        - Note any that need updates or recreation
        - Document which old versions to deprecate
      avoid:
        - Keeping multiple versions "just in case"
        - Skipping approval (wrong versions become canon)
        
    - step: 3
      action: "Create organized folder structure"
      responsible: Brand Manager
      duration: "1-2 hours"
      deliverable: "Folder structure with naming conventions"
      templates:
        - "Folder structure template"
        - "File naming convention guide"
      best_practices:
        - Organize by asset type then variant (logo/primary, logo/icon)
        - Use clear, descriptive names (not "final_v3_FINAL")
        - Include format in filename for easy scanning
        - Create README files explaining each folder
      avoid:
        - Deep nested folders (hard to navigate)
        - Abbreviations or codes only insiders understand
        
    - step: 4
      action: "Populate with approved assets"
      responsible: Designer / Brand Manager
      duration: "2-4 hours"
      deliverable: "Complete organized asset library"
      templates:

        - Export all needed formats from source files
        - Include both vector and raster for logos
        - Document export settings for reproducibility
        - Test files open correctly across platforms
      avoid:
        - Low-resolution exports
        - Missing color profiles
        - Corrupt or damaged files
        
    - step: 5
      action: "Remove or archive old versions"
      responsible: Brand Manager

      deliverable: "Clean asset landscape"
      templates:
        - "Deprecation checklist"
        - "Archive documentation"
      best_practices:
        - Archive (don't delete) in case needed for historical reference
        - Clearly mark archived folders (zz_archive, deprecated)
        - Remove from active shared locations
        - Update any direct links to old assets
      avoid:
        - Leaving old versions accessible (they will be used)
        - Permanent deletion (may need for legal or historical reasons)
        
    - step: 6
      action: "Set up access and permissions"
      responsible: Brand Manager
      duration: "30 minutes"
      deliverable: "Access controls configured"
      templates:
        - "Access matrix (who gets what)"
        - "Request process documentation"
      best_practices:
        - View access for most, edit access for few
        - External partner access via separate folder or link
        - Document who to contact for access issues
        - Regular access audits (quarterly)
      avoid:
        - Full edit access for everyone (invites chaos)
        - Overly restrictive (people work around it)
        
    - step: 7
      action: "Document and communicate"
      responsible: Brand Manager
      duration: "1-2 hours"

        - Create short video walkthrough
        - Link from onboarding materials
        - Include in contractor/agency briefs
        - Pin in relevant Slack channels
      avoid:
        - One announcement and done (repeat for visibility)
        - Documentation longer than 1 page

  cadence:
    frequency: "Monthly review, quarterly audit"
    triggers:
      - Brand refresh or update
      - New agency or partner onboarding
      - Requests for missing assets
      - Discovery of old versions in circulation
    ongoing:
      - Monitor for new format requests
      - Check that old versions aren't resurfacing
      - Add new assets as created
      - Update documentation as structure evolves

practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Building Asset Library from Scattered Files"
    practitioner: "Marketing Manager"
    organization_context: |
      30-person startup with brand created 3 years ago by a freelancer who's 
      no longer available. Logo files scattered across founder's Drive, old 
      agency folder, and various team members' computers. Different versions 
      in use across website, pitch deck, and social profiles.
    situation: |
      New hire asked for logo files. Founder sent a PNG from their desktop. 
      Designer found three different versions in various folders. Sales has 
      a version with slightly different blue. Nobody knows which is "official."
    trigger: |
      Website redesign revealed need for vector logo files. Couldn't find 
      original AI/EPS files. Had to recreate from scratch—expensive and 
      concerning. CEO said "fix this so it never happens again."
    actions: |
      Launched "brand asset archaeology" by emailing all team members asking 
      for any logo files they had, checking every shared drive and Dropbox 
      folder, and searching email for attachments from original designer. 
      Found 14 different logo files across 6 locations with 4 distinct 
      variations. Scheduled review with designer to identify correct version 
      and recreate missing vector files. Created single Google Drive folder 
      structure: assets/logos/primary/, assets/logos/icon/, assets/logos/
      wordmark/, with subfolders for light-bg/ and dark-bg/. Exported all 
      formats from source: SVG, EPS, PNG@1x, PNG@2x for each variant and 
      background, with consistent naming like "logo-primary-light-bg.svg". 
      Moved all old files to assets/_deprecated/ with clear warning README. 
      Created assets/README.md with folder map and "how to use" instructions. 
      Shared new location in all-hands, updated wiki, and pinned in Slack.
    outcome: |
      Asset hunting dropped from 20+ minutes to under 30 seconds. New hires 
      find correct assets without asking. Contractors receive link to assets 
      folder in every brief—no more "can you send me the logo?" emails. 
      Discovered and retired 2 old logo variations that were still being 
      used. Added photography and icons to same structure as they were created.
    lessons:
      - Asset archaeology is essential—you don't know what you don't know
      - One folder with clear structure beats multiple organized folders
      - Naming conventions matter more than you think
      - Old assets don't disappear—you have to actively remove them

    name: "Scaling Asset Management for Multiple Partners"
    practitioner: "Brand Manager"
    organization_context: |
      100-person company with 15+ agency and integration partners who regularly 
      need brand assets. Current process is partners email marketing for files, 
      marketing emails back whatever version they can find.
    situation: |
      Partners constantly request assets by email. Marketing spends 5+ hours 
      per week fulfilling requests. Partners receive different versions 
      depending on who responds. Some partners have outdated assets from 
      initial onboarding 2 years ago that they're still using.
    trigger: |
      Major integration partner launched feature announcement with 2-year-old 
      logo and wrong brand color. VP Marketing asked "why don't partners 
      have access to current assets?"
    actions: |
      Audited partner asset usage by checking all partner-created materials 
      found online, identifying 8 partners using outdated assets. Evaluated 
      DAM platforms but started simpler: created separate "Partner Assets" 
      Google Drive folder with link-only access. Curated partner-specific 
      subset including logo files in common formats, co-branding guidelines 
      (1-pager), color palette for their tools, and "powered by" badge 
      options. Created partner asset portal page on website with password 
      access linking to Drive. Set up quarterly partner asset audit as 
      calendar reminder and added asset portal link to partner onboarding 
      checklist. Reached out to 8 partners with outdated assets providing 
      updated files and friendly update request.
    outcome: |
      Partner asset requests dropped from 20+ per week to 2-3 (edge cases). 
      Marketing reclaimed 5+ hours per week. Partner materials started 
      appearing with correct branding within a month. Added usage tracking 
      to see which assets most requested and prioritized those formats. 
      Eventually moved to proper DAM but started with this MVP approach.
    lessons:
      - Partners don't want to email you—they'd rather self-serve
      - Curated subset for partners is better than access to everything
      - Include co-branding guidelines—partners need rules, not just files
      - Quarterly audits catch drift before it becomes embarrassing

    name: "Implementing DAM System for Growing Organization"
    practitioner: "Creative Director"
    organization_context: |
      150-person company with internal creative team, 5 agencies, and 20+ 
      partners. Outgrown folder-based asset management. Need version control, 
      usage rights tracking, and multi-format distribution.
    situation: |
      Creative team spends 15% of time managing asset requests and hunting 
      for files. Agencies have outdated assets causing rework. Can't track 
      which assets are used where. Legal concerned about unlicensed font 
      usage by partners. Leadership wants to professionalize.
    trigger: |
      Audit found licensed image used by partner without permission—cost 
      $5,000 to resolve. CEO approved investment in proper asset management 
      system to prevent recurrence.
    actions: |
      Evaluated DAM platforms against requirements: version control, external 
      sharing with permissions, usage rights tracking, format transformation, 
      and API access. Selected Bynder after pilot with top 3 options. Formed 
      implementation team with creative, marketing ops, and IT. Migrated 
      assets in phases starting with most-used assets and logos, then 
      photography, then templates, then archived materials. Set up permission 
      groups differentiating internal (full access), agency (curated access), 
      and partner (limited access). Configured automatic format transformation 
      so users can download in format they need. Added usage rights metadata 
      to all licensed assets and built approval workflow for external-facing 
      uses. Trained teams over 2 weeks with hands-on sessions. Sunset old 
      systems with 60-day transition period.
    outcome: |
      Asset retrieval time dropped from 10+ minutes to under 1 minute. Agency 
      rework from outdated assets dropped 80%. Full visibility into asset 
      usage across organization. No more licensing issues—rights tracked and 
      enforced. Creative team focus shifted from asset wrangling to creative 
      work. ROI achieved in 6 months through time savings alone.
    lessons:
      - Start with clear requirements before evaluating tools
      - Pilot before committing—DAM implementations are significant
      - Migration is the hard part—plan phases carefully
      - Training investment determines adoption success
      - Build from simple to complex—don't try to use every feature at launch

risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Assets still scattered despite organized library"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Actively remove old versions from all locations. Regular audits of 
        common repositories. Make the organized library the easiest place to 
        find assets. Include library link in all contexts where assets might 
        be needed.
        
    - risk: "Library becomes outdated as brand evolves"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Process for adding new assets immediately upon creation. Clear 
        ownership of library maintenance. Monthly review of recent brand 
        work to ensure captured in library. Version numbering on assets.
        
    - risk: "Access too restrictive, people work around it"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Balance access control with usability. View access should be generous. 
        Make requesting new formats easy. Quick response time on access requests. 
        Listen to feedback about friction.
        
    - risk: "File formats don't meet user needs"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Understand how assets are used before exporting. Include common formats 
        proactively (SVG, PNG, EPS, JPG). Document how to request new formats. 
        Track requests to identify gaps.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "No ownership of library maintenance"
      impact: |
        Library decays over time. New assets aren't added. Old versions 
        accumulate. Eventually library is abandoned and chaos returns.
      prevention: |
        Assign clear owner with this in their job description. Include 
        library maintenance in goals and reviews. Budget time for ongoing 
        management. Backup owner for coverage.
        
    - risk: "Over-engineering for current scale"
      impact: |
        Investment in complex DAM before it's needed. High setup cost, low 
        adoption. Features unused while paying for them. Distraction from 
        simpler solutions.
      prevention: |
        Start with simplest solution that works (folder structure). Add 
        complexity only when current approach breaks down. Clear triggers 
        for when to upgrade (partner count, asset volume, compliance needs).
