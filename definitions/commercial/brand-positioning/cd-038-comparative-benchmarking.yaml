definition:
  purpose: |
    Understanding how you compare to alternatives isn't optional—it's how 
    customers make decisions. Every prospect evaluates you against something: 
    competitors, status quo, or doing nothing. If you don't know how you 
    compare, you can't effectively position.
    
    Comparative benchmarking goes beyond listing competitor features. It 
    answers: Where do we genuinely win? Where do we honestly lose? What do 
    customers value when comparing? How do competitors position themselves? 
    Where is the market going?
    
    For early-stage companies, this starts with understanding the 3-5 
    alternatives your prospects consider. Not the 50 companies in your 
    industry—the handful that actually show up in deals. Know these deeply: 
    their strengths, weaknesses, pricing, positioning, and customer perception.
    
    The danger is competitor obsession—spending more time watching competitors 
    than serving customers. Competitive intelligence informs strategy but 
    doesn't replace customer focus. Know your competition, but compete on 
    customer value.
    
  outcome: |
    Sales team can confidently handle "how do you compare to X?" questions. 
    Product decisions informed by competitive landscape. Positioning 
    grounded in real differentiation. Marketing avoids claims that 
    competitors can also make.

  - id: ps-001
    name: "Building Competitive Intelligence from Scratch"
    practitioner: "Head of Product Marketing"
    organization_context: |
      30-person B2B startup with no formal competitive intelligence. Sales 
      team handles competitive questions on the fly with varying success. 
      Leadership has opinions about competitors but nothing documented.
    situation: |
      New enterprise prospect asked for detailed competitive comparison. 
      Sales rep improvised and got details wrong. Prospect fact-checked and 
      lost trust. Deal was lost. CEO asked why there are no competitive 
      resources for sales.
    trigger: |
      Post-mortem on lost deal revealed sales team lacks competitive 
      information. VP Sales asked Product Marketing to create competitive 
      resources within 30 days.
    actions: |
      Started with sales by interviewing top 5 reps to identify which 
      competitors come up in deals—names, frequency, how deals play out. 
      Narrowed to 4 key competitors that appear in 80% of competitive deals. 
      Spent 4 hours on each competitor doing deep research: website analysis, 
      G2 reviews, LinkedIn content, pricing (where available), customer 
      reviews. Talked to 3 customers who evaluated competitors during 
      purchase decision—asked what they liked and disliked about each. 
      Created one-page battlecard for each competitor covering overview, 
      positioning, pricing model, strengths, weaknesses, talk tracks for 
      common objections, and when they win. Tested battlecards with sales 
      team—got feedback, iterated. Added them to sales playbook with 
      5-minute training video. Set up Google Alerts and quarterly review 
      cadence.
    outcome: |
      Sales win rate against key competitors improved 20% in first quarter. 
      Reps report feeling confident in competitive conversations. Consistent 
      messaging across team—no more contradictory claims. Battlecards became 
      most-referenced sales assets. Added fifth competitor after it started 
      appearing in deals. Created process for sales to report new competitive 
      intelligence.
    lessons:
      - Start with the competitors that actually appear in deals
      - Customer perception of competitors is more valuable than your analysis
      - One-page battlecards get used, long documents don't
      - Sales feedback loop keeps competitive intel current

    name: "Responding to Aggressive New Competitor"
    practitioner: "VP Marketing"
    organization_context: |
      80-person established player in category. New well-funded competitor 
      launched with aggressive pricing and marketing. Getting attention and 
      starting to win some deals.
    situation: |
      New competitor raised $50M and is making noise. They're claiming to be 
      "the modern alternative" to incumbents (including us). Sales team is 
      panicking, requesting discounts to compete on price. Marketing wants 
      to respond but doesn't know how.
    trigger: |
      Lost second significant deal to new competitor. Sales says "we need 
      to match their pricing." CEO says "we need to understand what we're 
      dealing with before reacting."
    actions: |
      Conducted rapid deep dive on new competitor over one week. Analyzed 
      their product (free trial), messaging, pricing, target customer, and 
      leadership team. Interviewed 5 customers who evaluated them—understood 
      what attracted them and what concerned them. Assessed honestly where 
      they're genuinely better (UX, price, modern tech) and where they're 
      weaker (features, integrations, enterprise readiness, support). 
      Developed positioning response: don't compete on price, compete on 
      total value. Created messaging that acknowledges their strengths while 
      highlighting our differentiation (enterprise features, proven track 
      record, support quality). Built specific battlecard with objection 
      handling for "why should I pay more than Competitor X?" Trained sales 
      team on when to compete (enterprise, complex needs) and when to let 
      go (price-sensitive, simple needs). Updated website with "enterprise-
      ready" positioning without naming competitor.
    outcome: |
      Win rate stabilized after initial dip. Deals we should win, we're 
      winning—and with less discounting. Deals we were losing were wrong-fit 
      customers anyway. Six months later: new competitor struggling with 
      churn (customers hit limitations we knew about). Some of those customers 
      returning to us—created "returning customer" playbook.
    lessons:
      - Panic response (discount to compete) usually wrong
      - New competitors often have weaknesses that take time to show
      - Know when to compete and when to qualify out
      - Customers who choose on price often return when they hit problems

    name: "Using Competitive Intelligence to Inform Product Strategy"
    practitioner: "Chief Product Officer"
    organization_context: |
      120-person B2B company with competitive intelligence mostly used by 
      sales. Product team makes roadmap decisions without systematic 
      competitive input. Some features built reactively when competitors 
      launch.
    situation: |
      Product team builds features that don't differentiate—competitors have 
      the same things. Other features are built reactively after competitor 
      launches. No systematic way to assess competitive product positioning 
      and roadmap implications.
    trigger: |
      Strategic review revealed 60% of roadmap items are "competitive 
      catch-up" or features competitors already have. CEO asked "are we 
      leading or following?"
    actions: |
      Partnered with Product Marketing to integrate competitive intelligence 
      into product planning. Created competitive feature matrix showing 
      capabilities across all key competitors—highlighted white spaces where 
      no one excels. Assessed competitor apparent priorities based on recent 
      releases and messaging—where are they headed? Developed "differentiation 
      opportunities" list covering capabilities that could set us apart. 
      Built competitive input into roadmap process by adding competitive 
      context to feature briefs (who else has this? how would we differentiate?). 
      Created quarterly competitive product review combining product and 
      product marketing. Established "competitive response" criteria—not 
      every competitor feature needs matching. Developed framework for 
      deciding when to follow (table stakes), when to differentiate (strategic 
      capabilities), and when to ignore (not relevant to our segment).
    outcome: |
      Roadmap shifted from 60% reactive to 60% differentiation-focused. 
      Launched two category-defining features that competitors rushed to 
      copy. Product team feels empowered to say "we won't build that just 
      because competitor has it." Better story in sales—we lead, we don't 
      follow. Shortened cycles for competitive responses when needed because 
      process is clear.
    lessons:
      - Competitive intelligence should inform product, not just sales
      - Framework for when to respond vs. ignore prevents reactive building
      - White space analysis more valuable than feature matching
      - Quarterly competitive product review keeps strategy fresh

risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Competitive intelligence becomes stale"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Regular monitoring cadence (weekly light, quarterly deep). Triggers 
        for immediate updates (competitor announcements). Sales feedback 
        loop for real-world changes. Dated materials so staleness is visible.
        
    - risk: "Battlecards not used by sales"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Keep them short (one page). Involve sales in creation. Test with 
        reps before finalizing. Integrate into CRM or sales tools. Track 
        usage and iterate based on feedback.
        
    - risk: "Intelligence too focused on features, misses positioning"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Include positioning and messaging analysis, not just features. 
        Understand competitor's target customer and value prop. Assess 
        brand perception, not just capabilities.
        
    - risk: "Competitor obsession displaces customer focus"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Time-box competitive intelligence work. Primary input should be 
        customer needs, not competitor actions. Use competitive intel to 
        inform, not dictate, strategy. Ask "does this serve customers?" 
        not just "does this match competitors?"
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Reactive product strategy chasing competitors"
      impact: |
        Always following, never leading. Features copied without 
        differentiation. Resources wasted on catch-up instead of 
        innovation. Brand becomes "me too."
      prevention: |
        Clear framework for competitive response decisions. Differentiation 
        focus in product strategy. Say no to feature parity for its own 
        sake. Celebrate original capabilities, not catch-up.
        
    - risk: "Intelligence weaponized for internal politics"
      impact: |
        Teams use competitive intelligence to justify pet projects. Data 
        cherry-picked to support predetermined conclusions. Intelligence 
        function loses credibility.
      prevention: |
        Objective competitive intelligence function. Balance multiple 
        perspectives. Transparent methodology. Leadership commitment to 
        honest assessment.
