definition:
  purpose: |
    A picture is worth a thousand words—especially when explaining where you 
    fit in a market. Positioning maps visualize competitive landscape, 
    showing at a glance where different players sit and where opportunities 
    exist.
    
    The classic 2x2 matrix plots competitors on two dimensions that matter 
    to customers. But the power isn't in the chart—it's in choosing the 
    right dimensions. The axes should reflect how customers actually evaluate 
    options, not what you wish they cared about.
    
    Beyond competitive visualization, positioning maps reveal strategic 
    opportunity. Where is no one playing? Where is everyone crowded? What 
    positioning could differentiate you? Where is the market moving?
    
    For early-stage companies, a simple positioning map forces clarity. 
    Where do you actually sit today? Where do you want to be? What would it 
    take to move there? These questions drive strategic focus.
    
  outcome: |
    Clear visualization of competitive landscape that anyone can understand. 
    Strategic decisions informed by market position. Sales and marketing 
    aligned on differentiation story. Identified opportunities for 
    unique positioning.

      best_practices:
        - Use dimensions customers actually care about
        - Validate with customer research, not internal opinion
        - Consider both current and emerging evaluation criteria
        - Look for dimensions where you can credibly differentiate
      avoid:
        - Choosing axes just because you win on them
        - Using internal jargon customers don't use
        
    - step: 2
      action: "Research competitor positions"
      responsible: Product Marketing

      templates:
        - "Competitor positioning research template"
        - "Position assessment scoring guide"
      best_practices:
        - Assess where competitors actually are, not their marketing claims
        - Use customer perception data where available
        - Consider objective metrics (pricing, features) and subjective (brand)
        - Document evidence for positioning judgments
      avoid:
        - Positioning competitors where you want them to be
        - Relying only on competitor marketing materials
        
    - step: 3
      action: "Create positioning map(s)"
      responsible: Product Marketing

      templates:
        - "2x2 positioning matrix template"
        - "Multi-dimensional positioning framework"
      best_practices:
        - Start with most important dimensions first
        - Create segment-specific maps if positioning differs
        - Include current position AND where you want to be
        - Make maps clean and easy to understand
      avoid:
        - Cramming too many competitors (focus on key players)

      best_practices:
        - Look for underserved areas with customer demand
        - Assess feasibility of moving to white space
        - Consider why white space exists (is it unoccupied for good reason?)
        - Evaluate first-mover advantage potential
      avoid:
        - Assuming all white space is opportunity (some is empty for a reason)
        - Ignoring what it would take to credibly occupy new position
        
    - step: 5
      action: "Validate with stakeholders"

        - "Feedback collection template"
      best_practices:
        - Get input from sales (they know competitive reality)
        - Check with product (do capabilities match positioning?)
        - Validate with customer-facing teams
        - Be open to repositioning based on feedback
      avoid:
        - Presenting as final without input

practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Creating Positioning Clarity for Fundraising"
    practitioner: "CEO / Head of Marketing"
    organization_context: |
      15-person Series A startup preparing to raise Series B. Investors 
      asking "how do you differentiate?" Team has intuitive sense but no 
      clear visualization or articulation.
    situation: |
      Lead investor in potential Series B asked for competitive positioning 
      analysis. Current deck has slide showing "we're better" but no 
      structured market view. Other portfolio companies have clear 
      positioning maps that tell compelling stories.
    trigger: |
      Board member provided feedback: "You need a positioning map that 
      shows where you sit and why that's a winning position."
    actions: |
      Started with customer research—interviewed 10 recent customers about 
      how they evaluated options. Asked: "What were the key factors?" Two 
      dimensions emerged clearly: deployment complexity and analytics depth. 
      Customers repeatedly mentioned these as trade-offs. Plotted our top 
      5 competitors based on customer feedback and our assessment. Discovered 
      we sit in unique position: enterprise analytics depth with startup 
      deployment simplicity. Competitors either simple but shallow, or deep 
      but complex. Created clean 2x2 with labels: "Enterprise-Simple" (our 
      position), "SMB-Simple" (low-end), "Enterprise-Complex" (legacy vendors), 
      and white space in "SMB-Complex" (weird, no one wants this). Added 
      arrow showing market movement toward our quadrant as companies scale. 
      Created second map on price vs. breadth showing different view of 
      same opportunity. Validated with sales team—they agreed it reflected 
      deal conversations. Added to investor deck with narrative.
    outcome: |
      Investor reaction: "Now I understand your moat." Positioning map 
      became centerpiece of competitive strategy discussion. Used same 
      maps with sales team—improved ability to articulate differentiation. 
      Closed Series B with positioning as key investment thesis point. Maps 
      now used in sales decks, marketing, and internal strategy discussions.
    lessons:
      - Customer-derived dimensions are more credible than company opinion
      - Simple 2x2 more powerful than complex charts
      - Show market movement to position as tailwind
      - Same core positioning can be visualized multiple ways

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Repositioning After Market Shift"
    practitioner: "VP Marketing"
    organization_context: |
      70-person B2B company established in category for 5 years. Market 
      has evolved—new entrants and changing customer expectations. Current 
      positioning feels stale and doesn't differentiate like it used to.
    situation: |
      Win rates declining. Sales reports competitors positioning us as 
      "legacy." New entrants claiming modern, cloud-native, etc. Customer 
      research shows our brand associated with "reliable but old-school." 
      Reality: we've modernized product significantly but perception lags.
    trigger: |
      Executive offsite to develop 3-year strategy. CEO wants to understand 
      "where do we actually sit today, and where should we be?"
    actions: |
      Conducted positioning audit starting with customer perception research 
      through interviews and surveys asking where customers place us vs. 
      competitors on key dimensions. Found mismatch between perception and 
      reality—seen as less modern than we actually are. Created "perception 
      positioning map" showing where customers place everyone today. Created 
      "reality positioning map" showing where capabilities actually sit—we're 
      more modern than perceived. Identified repositioning opportunity: 
      we have product reality, need perception shift. Developed positioning 
      strategy with three tracks: product evidence (showcase modern 
      capabilities), messaging refresh (modern language without abandoning 
      reliability strength), and customer proof (new customer stories 
      emphasizing modern use cases). Created target positioning map showing 
      where we want to be in 18 months. Built roadmap connecting product, 
      marketing, and sales to achieve position shift. Set up tracking to 
      measure perception change over time.
    outcome: |
      18-month repositioning initiative launched. After 6 months, brand 
      tracker showed perception shift beginning. Win rate stabilized, then 
      improved. New positioning resonated with modern buyer while retaining 
      reliability credibility. Sales team excited about new story. 
      Competitors' "legacy" attack losing effectiveness.
    lessons:
      - Perception positioning can lag reality—that's a marketing opportunity
      - Repositioning requires coordinated product, marketing, and sales
      - Don't abandon strengths (reliability) while adding new position
      - Measure perception change over time

    name: "Finding White Space for Product Strategy"
    practitioner: "Chief Product Officer"
    organization_context: |
      100-person company with mature product. Market getting crowded with 
      similar offerings. Leadership asking: "Where should product go next?" 
      Feeling of "everyone looks the same."
    situation: |
      Product roadmap filled with feature parity items. No clear 
      differentiation strategy. Every competitor has similar capabilities. 
      Pricing pressure increasing as product becomes commoditized.
    trigger: |
      Annual strategy session. CEO challenged product: "Don't show me more 
      features. Show me where we can own a position no one else has."
    actions: |
      Started with positioning map audit—created maps on multiple dimensions 
      from customer research. Traditional dimensions (price, features, 
      ease-of-use) showed crowded space, everyone clustered. Looked for 
      emerging dimensions—where is market going? Customer interviews revealed 
      emerging need: vertical-specific solutions vs. horizontal platforms. 
      Current landscape is all horizontal—generic solutions for everyone. 
      Created new positioning map: horizontal-vertical on one axis, 
      sophistication on other. All competitors clustered in "horizontal-
      sophisticated" quadrant. White space identified: "vertical-sophisticated" 
      with no one there. Analyzed feasibility: could we credibly serve 
      verticals? Had strong customer base in two verticals (healthcare, 
      fintech). Developed "vertical-first" product strategy: deep 
      customization for two verticals while maintaining horizontal platform. 
      Positioning shift from "platform for everyone" to "purpose-built for 
      healthcare and fintech." Created roadmap with vertical-specific 
      features, integrations, compliance, and workflows.
    outcome: |
      Repositioned as vertical leader for two industries. First vertical 
      product released with industry-specific features. Win rate in 
      target verticals increased 40%. Pricing premium justified by 
      vertical focus. Competitors struggling to follow (they're built 
      horizontal). Clear differentiation story: "We're THE solution for 
      healthcare and fintech."
    lessons:
      - Look beyond traditional dimensions for emerging positioning opportunities
      - White space in new dimensions often more valuable than crowded traditional dimensions
      - Positioning decision drives product strategy
      - Can't be everything—vertical focus requires horizontal trade-offs

risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Positioning maps based on company opinion, not customer reality"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Ground dimensions and positions in customer research. Validate 
        with win/loss analysis. Test with customer-facing teams. 
        Challenge internal biases.
        
    - risk: "Beautiful maps that don't influence strategy"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Connect maps to strategic decisions. Use in planning and 
        prioritization. Integrate into product and marketing processes. 
        Reference in decision-making.
        
    - risk: "Static maps that become outdated"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Regular refresh cadence. Update triggers for market changes. 
        Track competitor movements. Reassess dimensions as market evolves.
        
    - risk: "Target position not achievable with current capabilities"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Honest assessment of capability gaps. Roadmap to close gaps. 
        Don't claim positions product can't support. Align positioning 
        with product strategy.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Wishful positioning disconnected from reality"
      impact: |
        Marketing claims positions product doesn't support. Sales 
        credibility damaged. Customers disappointed. Brand perception 
        negative.
      prevention: |
        Validate positioning with product reality. Get product sign-off 
        on claims. Close gap before claiming position. Be honest about 
        where you are today.
        
    - risk: "Positioning paralysis—can't commit to a position"
      impact: |
        Generic messaging that doesn't differentiate. Trying to be 
        everything to everyone. No clear identity. Lost in competitive 
        noise.
      prevention: |
        Force trade-off decisions. Accept that positioning means not 
        being for everyone. Leadership commitment to a position. Measure 
        differentiation, not just activity.
