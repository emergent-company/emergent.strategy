definition:
  purpose: |
    SWOT analysis is often dismissed as a basic exercise, but when done well, 
    it forces strategic clarity. It answers: What are we really good at 
    (that competitors aren't)? Where do we honestly fall short? What market 
    shifts could we capitalize on? What could hurt us if we ignore it?
    
    For brand positioning, SWOT creates the foundation for differentiation 
    strategy. You can't differentiate on a weakness or ignore a threat. You 
    should leverage strengths to capture opportunities. This framework, 
    despite its simplicity, prevents the magical thinking that dooms strategies.
    
    The value of SWOT isn't in the matrix—it's in the honest conversations 
    required to fill it. When the leadership team debates whether something 
    is really a strength or wishful thinking, that's where strategy happens.
    
    The danger is doing SWOT superficially: listing generic items, not 
    connecting to action, and never updating it. A SWOT that sits in a drawer 
    is worse than none—it gives false confidence that strategic analysis 
    was done.
    
  outcome: |
    Clear-eyed understanding of brand's competitive position. Strategic 
    priorities grounded in honest assessment. Shared vocabulary for discussing 
    strengths, gaps, and market dynamics. Foundation for positioning and 
    messaging decisions.

      templates:
        - "Evidence documentation template"
        - "Validation checklist"
      best_practices:
        - Each item needs at least one piece of evidence
        - Customer quotes and data trump internal opinions
        - Challenge items that "everyone knows" but can't prove
        - Remove or flag items without validation
      avoid:

        - Limit to 5-7 items per quadrant (focus)
        - Rank by strategic importance, not just size
        - Consider interconnections (strength enables opportunity)
        - Identify "critical few" in each quadrant
      avoid:
        - Keeping everything (defeats purpose of prioritization)
        - Equal weight to all items
        
    - step: 5

      best_practices:
        - "Use combinations: leverage S to capture O, address W to capture O"
        - Identify must-do vs. nice-to-do
        - Connect to existing strategic priorities
        - Note trade-offs and choices
      avoid:
        - Generic implications that don't drive action
        - Ignoring difficult implications

        - Specific actions, not vague goals
        - Clear owners and timelines
        - Realistic scope (can't address everything)
        - Integration with existing initiatives
      avoid:
        - Actions without owners
        - Too many actions (5-10 is plenty)
        
    - step: 7
      action: "Document and communicate"
      responsible: Strategy Lead
      duration: "2-4 hours"
      deliverable: "Final SWOT package"
      templates:

        - Executive summary for quick consumption
        - Full document for reference
        - Share broadly—SWOT should inform many decisions
        - Schedule review in calendar

practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "First SWOT Analysis for Strategic Clarity"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: |
      25-person startup that's been heads-down building product for 2 years. 
      Now raising Series A and investors ask about competitive positioning. 
      Leadership has intuitions but never done formal strategic analysis.
    situation: |
      Investor asked "what's your unfair advantage?" and "what keeps you up 
      at night?" CEO gave different answers in different meetings. Team 
      realized there's no shared understanding of strengths, weaknesses, 
      or market position.
    trigger: |
      Board member said "before Series A, you need to be able to articulate 
      your strategic position clearly—sounds like you haven't done the work." 
      CEO scheduled SWOT session.
    actions: |
      Prepared for the session by gathering customer feedback (NPS comments, 
      win/loss notes), competitive intelligence (marketing materials, G2 
      reviews), and sales insights (why we win, why we lose). Ran 3-hour 
      workshop with 6 people: CEO, CTO, VP Sales, VP Product, Head of 
      Customer Success, and marketing lead. Started with silent brainstorming 
      where each person wrote items on sticky notes for 10 minutes per 
      quadrant. Grouped and discussed, pushing back on items without evidence. 
      For strengths, asked "can competitors claim this too?" (removed 3 items). 
      For weaknesses, pushed for honesty beyond comfortable admissions. 
      Prioritized to top 5 per quadrant using dot voting. Developed strategic 
      implications: lead with technical differentiation (strength), address 
      enterprise readiness gap (weakness blocking opportunity), monitor but 
      don't overreact to larger competitor (threat, but serving different 
      segment). Documented in clear deck with evidence for each item. Shared 
      with broader team and board.
    outcome: |
      CEO gave consistent, confident answer to competitive positioning 
      questions in all investor meetings. Identified need to accelerate 
      enterprise features (weakness + opportunity). Sales team got positioning 
      ammunition from evidenced strengths. Board impressed with strategic 
      clarity. Used SWOT to inform Series A story and product roadmap.
    lessons:
      - SWOT forces the strategic conversations you've been avoiding
      - Evidence requirement separates real insights from wishful thinking
      - Cross-functional input catches blind spots in leadership view
      - Shared SWOT vocabulary helps team alignment

    name: "Using SWOT to Navigate Market Disruption"
    practitioner: "VP Strategy"
    organization_context: |
      80-person B2B company that's been market leader in niche for 5 years. 
      New category disruptor raised $100M and is getting attention. Leadership 
      worried but unsure how to respond.
    situation: |
      Disruptor is all over the press, winning some deals, and making 
      customers ask "should we switch?" Team is reactive—some want to copy 
      the disruptor, others say stay the course. No framework for deciding.
    trigger: |
      Lost a renewal to the disruptor. CEO called emergency meeting: "We 
      need to understand what we're dealing with and decide how to respond."
    actions: |
      Ran disruption-focused SWOT by reframing each quadrant around the 
      competitive threat. For strengths, identified what they have that 
      disruptor can't quickly replicate (installed base, integrations, 
      enterprise features, customer relationships). For weaknesses, honestly 
      assessed where disruptor is genuinely better (modern UX, pricing 
      model, speed of innovation). For opportunities, identified what the 
      disruption opens up (customers wanting proven + modern, competitors 
      distracted by disruptor, talent attracted to innovation). For threats, 
      assessed realistic scenarios (how fast can disruptor grow, what's 
      their weakness). Developed three response options: compete head-on 
      (try to match their innovation), differentiate up-market (own 
      enterprise, cede SMB), partner or acquire (if they're better, join 
      forces). Analyzed each option against SWOT and chose differentiate 
      up-market because it leverages strengths (enterprise features, 
      relationships) and avoids weakness (innovation speed). Created action 
      plan: accelerate enterprise roadmap, own the "enterprise-ready" 
      positioning, let disruptor have price-sensitive SMB.
    outcome: |
      Clear strategic response instead of panic. Team aligned on 
      differentiation path. Messaging updated to own "enterprise-ready" 
      positioning. Saved resources by not trying to match disruptor feature-
      for-feature. Six months later: enterprise retention strong, SMB churn 
      to disruptor acceptable, revenue grew because enterprise deals larger. 
      Disruptor struggling with enterprise complexity, validating the strategy.
    lessons:
      - SWOT can be focused on specific strategic questions (not just generic)
      - Sometimes the right response to disruption is to differentiate, not match
      - Honest weakness assessment prevents wasting resources on catch-up
      - Options analysis against SWOT makes decisions more rigorous

    name: "Quarterly SWOT Review for Strategy Calibration"
    practitioner: "Head of Strategy"
    organization_context: |
      150-person company with mature strategy function. Has done annual 
      SWOT for years but it becomes stale within months. Market moves 
      faster than annual planning cycles.
    situation: |
      Annual SWOT from January no longer reflects reality in June. Major 
      competitor acquired, new technology emerged, customer needs shifted. 
      Strategy team wants more dynamic approach without creating busywork.
    trigger: |
      Q2 strategy review revealed decisions being made on outdated SWOT. 
      CEO asked for a way to keep strategic analysis current without 
      constant reinvention.
    actions: |
      Designed quarterly SWOT refresh process that takes 2-4 hours, not 
      2-4 days. Created SWOT monitoring dashboard with items linked to 
      leading indicators (customer signals, competitive intelligence, 
      market data). Quarterly refresh reviews indicators first to see 
      what changed, then updates SWOT based on evidence of change. Added 
      "emerging items" section for things that might become S/W/O/T but 
      aren't there yet. Assigned ownership for each SWOT item to track 
      changes (sales owns win/loss items, product owns capability items). 
      Quarterly session is 90 minutes: 30 minutes reviewing what changed, 
      30 minutes updating the matrix, 30 minutes adjusting implications 
      and actions. Annual refresh remains comprehensive—quarterly is 
      calibration, not reinvention. Connected SWOT to quarterly business 
      reviews so strategy items are visible alongside operational metrics.
    outcome: |
      SWOT stays current throughout the year. Strategy decisions reference 
      recent analysis, not stale document. Changes are tracked, creating 
      strategic learning. Quarterly rhythm creates discipline without 
      bureaucracy. Emerging item section caught competitor M&A two months 
      before it happened (had been tracking as emerging threat).
    lessons:
      - Quarterly refresh is calibration, not re-creation
      - Leading indicators help spot changes before they're obvious
      - Ownership of SWOT items creates accountability for currency
      - Emerging items section captures what is coming before it arrives

risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "SWOT becomes box-checking exercise"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Require evidence for every item. Push back on generic statements. 
        Connect directly to strategic decisions and actions. If SWOT 
        doesn't inform decisions, why are you doing it?
        
    - risk: "Strengths overstated, weaknesses understated"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Include external perspectives (customers, advisors). Use data over 
        opinions. Ask "can competitors claim this too?" for strengths. 
        Look at losses for honest weakness assessment.
        
    - risk: "SWOT created and forgotten"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Connect to action plans with owners. Schedule quarterly review. 
        Reference in strategic decisions. Make it a living document, not 
        a one-time exercise.
        
    - risk: "Analysis paralysis—too much thinking, not enough doing"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Time-box the process. Limit items per quadrant. Focus on 
        implications and actions, not just the matrix. "Good enough" 
        SWOT that drives action beats perfect SWOT that doesn't.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Lack of candor produces useless SWOT"
      impact: |
        Weaknesses hidden or minimized. Threats dismissed. SWOT reflects 
        what team wants to believe, not reality. Strategy built on faulty 
        foundation.
      prevention: |
        Create psychological safety for honest input. Anonymous input 
        option. External facilitation for sensitive topics. Celebrate 
        candor, not just positive news. CEO models honest self-assessment.
        
    - risk: "SWOT becomes political document"
      impact: |
        Each function promotes their strengths, hides their weaknesses. 
        SWOT reflects internal politics, not market reality. Strategic 
        decisions distorted by bias.
      prevention: |
        Cross-functional participation with balanced influence. Evidence 
        requirement (can't assert without proof). External validation. 
        Focus on company-level, not department-level items.
