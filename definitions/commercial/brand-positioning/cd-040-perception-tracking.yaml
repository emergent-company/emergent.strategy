definition:
  purpose: |
    You can't manage what you don't measure—and that applies to brand 
    perception. How customers and prospects actually perceive you versus 
    how you intend to be perceived is critical market intelligence.
    
    Brand perception tracking answers: What words do people associate with 
    our brand? How do we compare to competitors in customer minds? Is our 
    repositioning working? Are we gaining or losing awareness? Which 
    attributes are we winning on?
    
    This isn't vanity metrics. Perception drives behavior. If prospects 
    perceive you as "too expensive," they don't engage. If they perceive 
    you as "enterprise-only," SMBs self-select out. If they perceive you 
    as "complex," they choose simpler alternatives.
    
    For early-stage companies, perception tracking starts simple: What do 
    customers say about you? What attributes come up in win/loss? What are 
    reviews saying? This qualitative understanding matters more than 
    sophisticated tracking until you have significant market presence.
    
  outcome: |
    Understanding of how brand is actually perceived vs. intended positioning. 
    Early warning of perception problems. Evidence of positioning 
    effectiveness over time. Data for marketing and messaging optimization.

        - Benchmark competitors on same dimensions
        - Keep list manageable (5-10 core attributes)
      avoid:
        - Tracking everything (focus on what matters)
        - Only tracking positive attributes (negatives matter too)
        
    - step: 2

  - id: ps-001
    name: "Building Brand Tracking from Scratch"
    practitioner: "Head of Marketing"
    organization_context: |
      40-person B2B startup growing rapidly. No formal brand tracking. 
      Anecdotal sense of perception based on sales conversations and 
      occasional customer feedback.
    situation: |
      CEO asked "how is our brand perceived in the market?" No real 
      answer beyond gut feel. Competitor positioning against us as "too 
      technical" but no data on whether that perception exists with 
      customers.
    trigger: |
      Board meeting included investor question about brand positioning. 
      CEO realized we have no data on brand perception to share.
    actions: |
      Started with what we have—analyzed all G2 reviews, Capterra reviews, 
      and NPS comments from past year. Created word cloud of most common 
      terms. Found key themes: "powerful," "technical," "complex," "great 
      support." Mixed bag—powerful is good, complex less so. Set up Google 
      Alerts for brand mentions and competitor mentions. Created simple 
      survey for new customers asking attribute associations (5-point scale 
      on 8 attributes). Added competitor comparison questions. Sent to 
      first 50 customers—got 30% response rate. Created baseline report 
      covering current perception across key attributes. Built simple 
      dashboard in Google Sheets tracking monthly review sentiment, NPS, 
      and survey scores. Presented findings to leadership—confirmed 
      "powerful but complex" perception. This informed product simplification 
      initiative and messaging clarification.
    outcome: |
      First-ever perception baseline established. Monthly tracking dashboard 
      in place. Six months later: complexity perception decreased 15% 
      (measured on survey). Review sentiment trending more positive on 
      ease of use. Leadership has data for brand decisions. Added perception 
      metrics to marketing quarterly review.
    lessons:
      - Start with what you have (reviews, NPS, customer feedback)
      - Simple survey better than no quantitative data
      - Baseline essential before trying to change perception
      - Connect perception to actions (complexity data → simplification initiative)

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Tracking Repositioning Effectiveness"
    practitioner: "VP Marketing"
    organization_context: |
      80-person established B2B company in repositioning initiative. 
      Shifting from "enterprise legacy" to "modern and agile." Significant 
      investment in repositioning but no way to measure if it's working.
    situation: |
      18 months into repositioning initiative. New messaging, new website, 
      new campaigns. Leadership asking "is the repositioning working?" 
      Marketing can show activity metrics but not perception change.
    trigger: |
      CFO challenged marketing spend with question: "How do we know our 
      brand investment is changing anything?"
    actions: |
      Realized we had no pre-repositioning baseline—mistake to start 
      measuring now but better late than never. Commissioned brand tracking 
      study with market research firm covering awareness, attribute 
      associations, and competitive perception among target buyers. Included 
      both customers and prospects. Key attributes tracked: modern, legacy, 
      innovative, reliable, complex, agile, enterprise-ready. Established 
      quarterly tracking with same methodology. Created perception scorecard 
      for leadership showing where we are on target attributes. Set targets 
      for 12-month perception goals (increase "modern" association by 20%, 
      decrease "legacy" by 30%). Integrated perception data with marketing 
      campaign analysis—which campaigns moving perception? Added perception 
      questions to win/loss interviews—how did perception affect deal? 
      Built correlation analysis between perception and pipeline metrics.
    outcome: |
      First tracking study showed we're still perceived as legacy (ouch, 
      but good to know). After 9 months: "modern" association up 15%, 
      "legacy" association down 25%. Can now show repositioning ROI in 
      perception terms. Identified campaigns most effective at shifting 
      perception—doubled down on those. Leadership trusts marketing 
      investment because results are measurable.
    lessons:
      - Track before you start repositioning (we learned the hard way)
      - Quarterly tracking needed to see trends, not just snapshot
      - Connect perception to business outcomes (pipeline, win rates)
      - Some campaigns move perception, others don't—tracking helps optimize

    name: "Responding to Negative Perception Crisis"
    practitioner: "Head of Brand"
    organization_context: |
      100-person company with strong brand. Recent product issues caused 
      customer frustration and negative reviews. Brand perception at risk 
      of lasting damage.
    situation: |
      Product outage affected many customers. Negative reviews spiked on 
      G2 and social media. NPS dropped 20 points. "Unreliable" suddenly 
      appearing in brand associations. Years of positive perception at 
      risk.
    trigger: |
      CEO saw viral negative post on LinkedIn. Customer churn spike. 
      Sales reporting prospects mentioning "reliability concerns."
    actions: |
      Immediately ramped up perception monitoring—daily tracking of review 
      sentiment, social mentions, and brand associations. Created crisis 
      perception dashboard showing real-time sentiment. Tracked negative 
      themes: "outage," "unreliable," "poor communication," "slow response." 
      Measured share of voice—how much conversation is about incident? 
      Established baseline of "reliability" perception before incident 
      (was 85% positive, now 45%). Set recovery targets: return to 75% 
      reliability perception within 90 days. Created perception recovery 
      plan coordinated with product, support, and PR. Tracked response to 
      each recovery action (CEO apology, compensation program, reliability 
      improvements). Monitored competitor attempts to capitalize. Provided 
      daily perception briefings to leadership during crisis, then weekly 
      as situation stabilized.
    outcome: |
      Perception bottomed after 2 weeks, then slowly recovered. 90-day 
      target: achieved 72% reliability perception (close). 180-day: back 
      to 82%. Some lasting damage with affected customers, but new 
      customers showed clean perception. Created "perception crisis 
      playbook" for future incidents. Implemented ongoing reliability 
      perception tracking as permanent metric.
    lessons:
      - Crisis requires immediate perception monitoring ramp-up
      - Track specific negative themes, not just overall sentiment
      - Set recovery targets and track progress
      - Coordinate perception response with operational response

risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Vanity metrics that don't drive action"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Focus on metrics connected to business outcomes. Require action 
        plans for perception insights. Track actions taken based on data. 
        Kill metrics no one uses.
        
    - risk: "Survey fatigue and declining response rates"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Keep surveys short. Rotate respondent pools. Offer incentives. 
        Combine with other research when possible. Consider passive 
        measurement alternatives.
        
    - risk: "Inconsistent methodology prevents trend analysis"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Document methodology precisely. Use same questions and scales 
        over time. Resist urge to "improve" questions mid-stream. 
        Note any methodology changes.
        
    - risk: "Perception data arrives too late to act"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Mix real-time monitoring (social, reviews) with periodic 
        measurement. Set up alerts for significant shifts. Faster 
        feedback loops for critical metrics.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Perception tracking becomes marketing ego metric"
      impact: |
        Tracking used to justify marketing rather than improve it. 
        Cherry-picking positive data, ignoring negative. Lost credibility 
        with leadership.
      prevention: |
        Report negative perception honestly. Connect to business outcomes. 
        Use data to improve, not just celebrate. Third-party measurement 
        for objectivity.
        
    - risk: "Over-reaction to short-term perception fluctuations"
      impact: |
        Strategy whiplash based on noisy data. Resources wasted on 
        perception fires that would self-correct. Loss of long-term 
        focus.
      prevention: |
        Focus on trends, not single data points. Establish significance 
        thresholds for action. Balance quick response with patience. 
        Distinguish signal from noise.
