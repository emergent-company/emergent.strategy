definition:
  purpose: |
    Your brand speaks in every email, social post, error message, and sales 
    conversation. Without defined verbal guidelines, every writer invents 
    their own voice. The result is a brand that sounds like different people 
    depending on who touched it—because it is.
    
    Verbal guidelines create consistency in how your brand sounds. Not to 
    make everything sound the same, but to make everything sound like the 
    same company. A support email should sound different from a marketing 
    campaign, but both should be recognizably "you."
    
    For early-stage companies, this starts with answering simple questions: 
    Are we formal or casual? Do we use emoji? Do we say "we" or "our team"? 
    What do we call our customers? These decisions, documented, prevent 
    endless debates and inconsistent output.
    
    The cost of undefined verbal identity shows up in brand confusion 
    (customers don't know what to expect from you), wasted time (writers 
    guessing or debating), and off-brand content (especially from contractors 
    and agencies who don't have context).
    
  outcome: |
    All brand communications sound like the same company. Writers have clear 
    guidance and spend less time debating style. Agencies and contractors 
    produce on-voice content without extensive hand-holding. Brand develops 
    a distinctive voice that customers recognize.

    name: "Creating Voice Guidelines from Founder's Intuition"
    practitioner: "Marketing Manager"
    organization_context: |
      20-person B2B startup where the founder has strong instincts about 
      brand voice but nothing documented. Founder writes great content but 
      can't explain why it works. Hiring content people who need direction.
    situation: |
      New content hire asks "how should this sound?" and founder responds 
      "you know, like us." Content comes back and founder says "this doesn't 
      sound right" but can't articulate why. Multiple revision cycles 
      frustrate everyone. Founder spending hours rewriting content.
    trigger: |
      Third content hire asked for brand voice guidelines. Realization that 
      the voice lives only in founder's head—not scalable and blocking 
      content production.
    actions: |
      Scheduled 90-minute "voice extraction" session with founder by pulling 
      founder's best content samples (emails customers loved, product 
      descriptions, blog posts). Read samples aloud and asked "what makes 
      this sound like us?" Captured recurring patterns: sentences are short 
      and punchy, technical concepts explained simply, humor used sparingly 
      but purposefully, we sound confident but not arrogant. Created simple 
      framework with 4 voice attributes: clear (simple sentences, no jargon), 
      confident (direct statements, avoid hedging), human (conversational, 
      appropriate humor), and smart (respect reader intelligence). Wrote 
      before/after examples for each attribute showing same concept with and 
      without the attribute. Created 1-page quick reference with attributes, 
      examples, and common mistakes. Tested guidelines by having new hire 
      apply them to a piece, then founder reviewed. Iterated twice based on 
      what was still being missed.
    outcome: |
      Content revision cycles dropped from 4-5 rounds to 1-2. New content 
      hire producing on-voice content within 2 weeks. Founder spending 75% 
      less time on content edits. Added tone variations section after first 
      month when support emails needed different treatment than marketing. 
      Guidelines fit on 3 pages—kept it simple intentionally.
    lessons:
      - Extract voice from best existing content, don't invent from scratch
      - Founders often know voice intuitively but can't articulate—help them
      - Before/after examples worth more than abstract descriptions
      - Start with 3-4 attributes, add nuance after basics are established

    name: "Maintaining Voice Consistency Across Distributed Teams"
    practitioner: "Brand Director"
    organization_context: |
      120-person company with content created by marketing (4 people), product 
      (8 PMs writing copy), support (15 agents), and sales (20 reps). Plus 
      3 agencies. Each group has evolved their own writing style.
    situation: |
      Customer survey shows brand perception as "inconsistent" and "confusing." 
      Analysis reveals wildly different voices: marketing is hip and casual, 
      product is technical and formal, support is robotic, sales decks are 
      aggressive. Same company sounds like 4 different companies.
    trigger: |
      New CMO did brand voice audit as part of onboarding. Presented findings 
      to exec team with examples of inconsistency. CEO asked "can we sound 
      like one company?"
    actions: |
      Assembled cross-functional voice working group with reps from each 
      content-creating team. Analyzed samples from each group to find common 
      ground by asking what does each do well that reflects our values. Built 
      unified voice framework preserving what works from each: clarity from 
      product, warmth from support, energy from marketing, directness from 
      sales. Created department-specific guidelines layered on core voice by 
      documenting how the core voice adapts for each context while staying 
      recognizably unified. Developed voice calibration exercises as 15-minute 
      workshops for each team to practice applying voice. Established "voice 
      champions" in each department as go-to resources for voice questions. 
      Created Slack channel for voice questions with quick responses. Built 
      voice review into content workflows by adding voice checklist to content 
      approval. Ran quarterly voice audits pulling samples from each team 
      and scoring consistency.
    outcome: |
      Customer perception of brand consistency improved 40% in next survey. 
      Cross-functional content reviews went from contentious to collaborative. 
      Time to produce on-brand content reduced—fewer revisions needed. 
      Agencies aligned within one month using new guidelines. Sales team 
      took longest but got there with dedicated training sessions.
    lessons:
      - Unified voice doesn't mean identical—allow contextual adaptation
      - Voice champions in each department scale training and adoption
      - Regular audits catch drift before it becomes entrenched
      - Quick-response Slack support better than perfect documentation

    name: "Evolving Voice During Brand Repositioning"
    practitioner: "Head of Brand"
    organization_context: |
      80-person B2B company repositioning from scrappy startup to enterprise-
      ready platform. Existing voice is casual, playful, and irreverent—
      resonated with SMB customers but feels wrong for enterprise buyers.
    situation: |
      Moving upmarket but voice sounds like it's still selling to startups. 
      Enterprise prospects say the brand "doesn't seem serious enough." 
      Sales team asked to adopt more formal tone but got pushback from 
      marketing about losing brand personality. Internal debate about how 
      much voice needs to change.
    trigger: |
      Lost enterprise deal where feedback included "didn't feel like an 
      enterprise vendor—too informal." CEO asked for voice evolution plan 
      that maintains personality while credible for enterprise.
    actions: |
      Researched how other brands evolved voice during upmarket moves by 
      analyzing companies like Slack (startup to enterprise), Zoom, and 
      Stripe to identify the changes they made. Defined "sophisticated 
      casual" as the target positioning: still warm and human, but with more 
      substance and less flippancy. Created voice evolution framework that 
      keeps human and approachable, adds depth and expertise, removes forced 
      humor and startup clichés, and adjusts formality by audience. Developed 
      dual-track guidelines for SMB communications (keep current voice, 
      slight maturity) and enterprise communications (elevated formality, 
      substance focus). Created voice transition guide for all content 
      creators showing what changes and what stays. Updated key touchpoints 
      first: website, sales materials, product UI, then everything else. 
      Monitored feedback from both SMB and enterprise customers to calibrate 
      balance.
    outcome: |
      Enterprise win rate improved 25% in quarters following voice evolution. 
      SMB customers didn't notice negative change—some commented brand felt 
      "more polished." Sales team more confident in enterprise conversations. 
      Successfully straddled both markets without alienating either. Voice 
      continues to evolve as enterprise mix grows.
    lessons:
      - Voice evolution doesn't mean abandoning personality—refine, don't replace
      - Dual-track approach works when serving different audiences
      - Start with highest-impact touchpoints, cascade to everything else
      - Monitor both audiences to ensure neither is alienated

risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Guidelines too vague to be actionable"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Include many specific examples. Test guidelines by having someone 
        who hasn't been involved apply them to real content. If they can't 
        produce on-voice content, guidelines aren't clear enough.
        
    - risk: "Voice sounds different across channels"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Document channel-specific adaptations explicitly. Regular cross-
        channel audits. Central review of major content launches. Slack 
        channel for voice questions encourages consistency.
        
    - risk: "Contractors and agencies ignore guidelines"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Include voice guidelines in every agency/contractor brief. Review 
        initial work carefully and provide feedback. Build voice review into 
        approval workflow. Consider voice training for key partners.
        
    - risk: "Guidelines become outdated"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Annual comprehensive review. Process for adding new guidance as 
        questions arise. Version dating on guidelines. Ownership assigned 
        for maintenance.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "No one enforces voice consistency"
      impact: |
        Guidelines exist but aren't followed. Voice fragments over time. 
        Investment in creating guidelines wasted. Brand loses distinctive voice.
      prevention: |
        Build voice review into content workflows. Assign voice champions. 
        Include voice consistency in content performance reviews. Celebrate 
        great examples of voice execution.
        
    - risk: "Voice valued over message effectiveness"
      impact: |
        Content sounds right but doesn't convert. Voice becomes more important 
        than clarity. Writers optimize for style over substance.
      prevention: |
        Measure content performance, not just voice compliance. Allow voice 
        flexibility when testing. Don't let voice become excuse for poor 
        performing content. Clear hierarchy: clarity > voice > style.
