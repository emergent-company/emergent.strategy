  purpose: |
    Social media outreach builds visibility, trust, and community 
    through strategic presence on social platforms. For startups, 
    social media is often the most cost-effective way to reach 
    target audiences.
    
    Why social media matters for startups:
    
    1. Zero cost to start. Unlike paid channels, organic social 
       requires only time.
    
    2. Direct access. Reach prospects, investors, and talent 
       directly where they spend time.
    
    3. Credibility building. Consistent, thoughtful presence 
       builds trust over time.
    
    4. Community. Social creates relationships, not just 
       impressions.
    
    5. Amplification. Good content gets shared, extending reach 
       beyond followers.
    
    Key social platforms for B2B startups:
    
    1. LinkedIn: Professional network, best for B2B thought 
       leadership and lead generation.
    
    2. Twitter/X: Real-time conversation, good for building 
       personal brands and industry engagement.
    
    3. YouTube: Long-form educational content, demos, and 
       tutorials.
    
    4. Instagram: Visual storytelling, culture, and employer 
       branding.
    
    5. TikTok: Emerging for B2B, particularly for reaching 
       younger decision-makers.
    
  outcome: |
    Growing audience of target prospects and influencers. 
    Consistent visibility and engagement. Pipeline contribution 
    from social activities. Strong personal and company brands.
