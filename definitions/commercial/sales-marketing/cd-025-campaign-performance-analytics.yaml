  purpose: |
    Campaign performance analytics transforms marketing data 
    into actionable insights. Without analytics, you're 
    flying blind - spending money without knowing what works.
    
    Why analytics matters:
    
    1. Accountability. Prove marketing ROI to leadership 
       and board. Show impact on pipeline and revenue.
    
    2. Optimization. Data reveals what's working and what's 
       not. Enable continuous improvement.
    
    3. Planning. Historical data informs future decisions. 
       Budget allocation, channel mix, campaign timing.
    
    4. Learning. Build organizational knowledge about what 
       resonates with your market.
    
    5. Alignment. Shared metrics align marketing with sales 
       and business objectives.
    
    Key analytics domains:
    
    1. Campaign analytics: Performance of specific campaigns
    2. Channel analytics: Comparison across channels
    3. Attribution: How channels work together
    4. Funnel analytics: Conversion through stages
    5. ROI analytics: Business impact measurement
    
  outcome: |
    Clear visibility into campaign performance. Data-driven 
    optimization decisions. Credible ROI reporting. 
    Continuous improvement based on evidence.
