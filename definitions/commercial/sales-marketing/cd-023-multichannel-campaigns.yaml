definition:
  purpose: |
    Multichannel campaigns coordinate messaging across multiple 
    marketing channels to amplify impact and reach audiences 
    wherever they are. Modern buyers interact across email, 
    social, search, web, and more - campaigns must meet them.
    
    Why multichannel matters:
    
    1. Reach and frequency. Prospects need 7-10+ touches before 
       they engage. Single channels rarely deliver enough.
    
    2. Meet buyers where they are. Different people prefer 
       different channels. Multichannel ensures you reach them.
    
    3. Reinforced messaging. Consistent message across channels 
       builds recognition and trust.
    
    4. Maximize investment. Content and campaigns work harder 
       when amplified across channels.
    
    5. Attribution clarity. See how channels work together 
       to drive conversions.
    
    Common multichannel campaign types:
    
    1. Product launch: Announce new features or products 
       across all channels.
    
    2. Content campaigns: Promote major content pieces through 
       coordinated distribution.
    
    3. Event campaigns: Drive event registration and follow-up 
       across channels.
    
    4. ABM campaigns: Target specific accounts through 
       personalized multichannel outreach.
    
    5. Nurture campaigns: Guide prospects through journey 
       with coordinated touches.
    
  outcome: |
    Campaigns that reach audiences across preferred channels. 
    Consistent messaging that builds recognition. Higher 
    engagement and conversion through coordinated touches. 
    Clear attribution of channel contribution.
