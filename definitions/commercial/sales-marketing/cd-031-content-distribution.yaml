  - id: ps-001
    name: "Building Distribution from Scratch"
    practitioner: "Marketing Manager"
    organization_context: "20-person seed-stage B2B SaaS startup"
    situation: |
      Priya leads marketing at a 20-person seed-stage B2B SaaS startup. They've
      started creating blog content but have no systematic distribution. Posts
      go live on the blog and occasionally get shared on the CEO's LinkedIn, 
      but there's no process. Traffic is minimal despite decent content quality.
    trigger: "CEO asks why no one is reading content after 3 months of publishing"
    actions: |
      1. Priya assesses available channels: blog (no traffic), company LinkedIn 
         (200 followers), CEO LinkedIn (5,000 followers), email list (800 
         subscribers, no regular sends), dormant Twitter. Prioritizes LinkedIn 
         and email, deprioritizes Twitter. Focus logic: CEO has audience, email 
         list is underutilized.
      2. Creates simple distribution checklist in Notion: Day 0 publish with 
         SEO, post to company LinkedIn, CEO shares with commentary. Days 2-5 
         additional LinkedIn posts from different angles. Week 2 cross-link 
         and add to email nurture sequences.
      3. Launches bi-weekly email newsletter: 1 featured article, 2-3 content 
         items, 1 company update. Uses existing Mailchimp, Tuesday 10am sends. 
         Achieves 32% open rate and 4.2% CTR.
      4. Develops LinkedIn strategy: company posts 3-4x per week, CEO amplifies 
         key posts with personal take, encourages employee sharing with 
         suggested copy. Grows company page from 200 to 800 followers.
      5. Tracks results with simple dashboard: blog traffic by source, 
         LinkedIn performance, email metrics. Discovers how-to content 
         outperforms 2:1, CEO shares get 5x engagement. Adjusts content mix.
    outcome: |
      After 3 months of systematic distribution, blog traffic increases 5x.
      LinkedIn becomes 25% of blog visits. Email newsletter has 1,200 
      subscribers with 30%+ open rates. Repeatable process established.
    lessons:
      - "Focus on 2-3 channels maximum - do them well before expanding"
      - "CEO/founder amplification dramatically increases reach"
      - "Simple repeatable checklist beats complex process"
      - "Track what works and double down on winners"

    name: "Scaling Distribution with Paid Amplification"
    practitioner: "Content Marketing Manager"
    organization_context: "Series B B2B SaaS with $5K/month amplification budget"
    situation: |
      David manages content at a Series B B2B SaaS company. Organic distribution
      is working well - 15K email subscribers, active LinkedIn, decent SEO. 
      But growth has plateaued and leadership wants faster results. They've 
      approved $5K/month for content amplification.
    trigger: "VP of Marketing approves $5K/month for paid amplification with 90-day deadline"
    actions: |
      1. David develops amplification strategy: prioritizes gated resources 
         (ebooks, reports) for primary spend, high-performing blog posts for 
         secondary. Allocates $3K LinkedIn, $1K Meta remarketing, $1K testing. 
         Sets goals: CPL <$50, 100 downloads/month minimum.
      2. Launches LinkedIn campaigns: lead gen ads for industry report, 
         sponsored content for best blog posts. Targets VP/Director titles, 
         target industries, 100-5000 employee companies. Tests 3 headlines 
         and 2 images per campaign.
      3. Monitors and learns in month 1: Week 1-2 shows $65 CPL (above target), 
         identifies tactical content outperforms broad. Optimizes by narrowing 
         targeting, refreshing copy. Week 3-4 achieves $48 CPL with 85 leads.
      4. Layers in Meta remarketing: builds audiences from blog visitors, 
         content engagers. Serves gated content to blog visitors. Achieves 
         $22 remarketing CPL (vs $48 prospecting) with 4.2% conversion rate.
      5. Establishes testing program: weekly tests of headline, image, 
         audience, offer variations. Discovers winning patterns (numbers in 
         headlines +20% CTR, specific role targeting +40% lower CPL). Winners 
         get 2x budget, losers paused within 7 days.
    outcome: |
      After 90 days: 380 leads generated (target 300), average CPL $42, 
      content reach 8x organic baseline. VP approves budget increase to 
      $7K/month. Clear playbook established for paid amplification.
    lessons:
      - "Start with clear content prioritization before spending"
      - "First month is learning - expect to optimize, not perfect"
      - "Remarketing dramatically outperforms prospecting on CPL"
      - "Continuous testing with 20% budget drives compounding improvement"

    name: "Maximizing Reach Through Earned Distribution"
    practitioner: "Head of Content"
    organization_context: "5-person content team at mid-market B2B company"
    situation: |
      Aisha leads a 5-person content team at a mid-market B2B company. They have 
      strong owned channels (50K email list, 20K LinkedIn followers, 100K monthly
      blog visitors) and do well with paid. But earned media and influencer 
      distribution is non-existent.
    trigger: "CMO challenges team to reach people who've never heard of the company"
    actions: |
      1. Aisha builds influencer strategy: identifies analysts (Forrester, 
         Gartner), thought leaders, podcast hosts, newsletter authors. Creates 
         3-tier map: Tier 1 (5 top voices), Tier 2 (15 active leaders), Tier 3 
         (30 emerging voices). Audits relationship status and begins genuine 
         engagement before asking anything.
      2. Creates original research: surveys 500 industry professionals on 
         trending issue. Designs for shareability with counterintuitive 
         findings. Produces full report (gated), executive summary, blog post, 
         infographic, social stat cards, and press release.
      3. Executes media outreach: targets 5 industry publications, 10 
         journalists, 3 business outlets. Personalized pitches with exclusive 
         angles and complete press kit. Achieves 3 industry publication 
         features, 1 business outlet mention, 200+ social shares.
      4. Activates influencer relationships: includes influencer quotes in 
         content (natural amplification), shares research early with top 
         voices, arranges podcast appearances and joint webinars. Schedules 
         analyst briefings. Achieves 12 influencer shares, 3 podcast bookings.
      5. Amplifies through employee and customer advocacy: creates Slack 
         channel with pre-written posts, gamifies participation. Asks customers 
         for LinkedIn shares, features them in content. Achieves 30% employee 
         participation, 8 customer shares per major piece.
    outcome: |
      After 6 months: 15 earned media mentions (from 0), 25 active influencer 
      relationships, 6 podcast appearances, 2,000+ research downloads, 500K+ 
      extended reach. Company now seen as thought leader with inbound PR 
      inquiries.
    lessons:
      - "Build influencer relationships before asking - engage genuinely first"
      - "Original research creates newsworthy content that earns coverage"
      - "Include influencer quotes - they'll naturally share content featuring them"
      - "Employee advocacy multiplies reach at no cost"

risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Over-promotion causing audience fatigue"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Balance promotional content with value-first content (80/20 rule). Monitor 
        unsubscribe rates, engagement decline, and negative feedback. Segment audiences 
        by tolerance for promotional content. Quality over frequency.
        
    - risk: "Platform algorithm changes affecting reach"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Diversify across channels - never over-rely on single platform. Build owned 
        audiences (email, community) that aren't subject to algorithm changes. Stay 
        adaptable and informed about platform updates. Test new formats early.
        
    - risk: "Paid amplification ROI turning negative"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Continuous campaign optimization based on performance data. Set strict ROI 
        thresholds and kill underperforming campaigns quickly. Regular audits of all 
        paid spend. Test before scaling. Track lifetime value, not just initial conversion.
        
    - risk: "Brand safety issues with third-party distribution"
      likelihood: low
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Thoroughly vet all distribution partners before engagement. Use brand safety 
        tools and placement monitoring. Clear contractual protections. Regular audits 
        of where content appears. Swift action on violations.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Distribution becomes disconnected from content quality"
      impact: |
        Push to distribute mediocre content widely. Audience trust erodes as they 
        see too much promotional, low-value content. Distribution team optimizes for 
        reach over resonance.
      prevention: |
        Quality gates before distribution decisions. Distribution team understands 
        content strategy, not just channel mechanics. Measure quality metrics alongside 
        reach metrics. Right to refuse distribution of poor content.
        
    - risk: "Channel proliferation without mastery"
      impact: |
        Team spread thin across too many channels. No channel gets enough attention 
        to perform well. Consistency and quality suffer everywhere. Constant scramble 
        to keep up with all platforms.
      prevention: |
        Focus on fewer channels done excellently. Master before expanding. Clear criteria 
        for adding new channels. Willingness to exit underperforming channels. Match 
        channel count to team capacity.
