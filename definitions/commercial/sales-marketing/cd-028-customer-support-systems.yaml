  purpose: |
    Customer support systems enable efficient, high-quality 
    help when customers need it. Great support builds loyalty, 
    reduces churn, and provides product feedback.
    
    Why support matters:
    
    1. Retention driver. Poor support causes churn. Good 
       support turns problems into loyalty.
    
    2. Product feedback. Support is frontline for product 
       issues and improvement ideas.
    
    3. Customer success. Helping customers succeed with 
       your product drives value realization.
    
    4. Competitive advantage. Support quality differentiates 
       in crowded markets.
    
    5. Efficiency enabler. Systems scale support without 
       linear team growth.
    
    Support system components:
    
    1. Channels: How customers reach you
    2. Ticketing: How requests are managed
    3. Knowledge: Self-service resources
    4. Team: Who provides support
    5. Metrics: How quality is measured
    
  outcome: |
    Fast, effective support that resolves issues. High 
    customer satisfaction scores. Efficient support 
    operations. Product feedback loop. Reduced churn.
