  purpose: |
    Personalization delivers relevant experiences to each 
    customer based on their characteristics, behavior, and 
    context. It increases engagement by making every 
    interaction feel tailored.
    
    Why personalization matters:
    
    1. Cut through noise. Inboxes and feeds are crowded. 
       Personalized content stands out.
    
    2. Increase conversion. Relevant messages convert better. 
       Personalization improves CTR and conversion rates.
    
    3. Build relationships. Personalization shows you understand 
       customers. Builds trust and loyalty.
    
    4. Improve efficiency. Better targeting means less waste. 
       Higher ROI on marketing investment.
    
    5. Enable scale. Personalization automates what would 
       require 1:1 manual effort.
    
    Personalization dimensions:
    
    1. Who: Based on firmographics, persona, account
    2. What: Based on interests, behavior, stage
    3. When: Based on timing, triggers, lifecycle
    4. Where: Based on channel, device, context
    5. How: Based on preferences, history
    
  outcome: |
    Higher engagement rates across channels. Improved 
    conversion throughout funnel. Better customer 
    experience and satisfaction. Increased marketing 
    ROI through relevance.
