definition:
  purpose: |
    Fundraising is sales - you're selling equity in your company to professional 
    investors. The roadshow is your campaign: systematically meeting investors, 
    telling your story, building relationships, and ultimately closing the round.
    
    Most founders underestimate fundraising:
    - It takes 3-6 months (often longer)
    - You'll talk to 50-100 investors for 5-10 term sheets
    - 90%+ will say no (rejection is normal)
    - It's a full-time job while running a company
    
    The goal is to create a competitive process: multiple interested investors, 
    time pressure, and leverage to negotiate terms. Without this, you're 
    negotiating from weakness.
    
  outcome: |
    A fundraising process that:
    - Generates multiple term sheets
    - Creates competitive dynamics
    - Closes in reasonable time (3-6 months)
    - Finds the right partner (not just any money)

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "First-time founder running first fundraise"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: "4-person pre-seed startup, founder has no investor network, raising $1.5M"
    situation: |
      Priya (CEO, first-time founder) has built an MVP with early traction 
      ($10K MRR). She knows she needs to raise money but has no investor 
      relationships. Her network is mostly other engineers and product people. 
      She's heard fundraising is "all about warm intros" but doesn't know 
      where to get them. Imposter syndrome is strong: "Why would any investor 
      talk to me?"
    trigger: "Runway is 6 months; need to start raising now"
    actions: |
      1. Priya realizes she needs to build an investor network from scratch.
         Starts by listing everyone she knows who might know investors:
         former bosses, alumni network, founder friends, lawyers.
      2. Research phase: Builds list of 100 pre-seed/seed investors who invest 
         in her space (B2B SaaS, India/US). Uses Crunchbase and Twitter to 
         find active investors. Notes who invested in companies like hers.
      3. Categorizes investors by fit (Tier 1-3) and identifies intro paths. 
         Tier 1 has 25 investors - she can find intro paths to 15 of them.
      4. Activates network: Asks existing angel investor (who put in $25K) 
         for 5 intros. Asks lawyer for 3 intros. Asks accelerator alumni 
         network for connections. Gets 15 warm intros over 3 weeks.
      5. Cold outreach for rest: Crafts personalized emails to 30 investors 
         with no intro path. Gets 4 responses (13% rate).
      6. Starts meetings with Tier 2/3 first to practice pitch. Gets feedback: 
         "Your story is confusing" and "What's the big vision?" Refines deck 
         and narrative before Tier 1 meetings.
      7. Tier 1 meetings go better. 4 investors interested, 2 want partner 
         meetings. Creates soft deadline: "We're aiming to close by end of 
         next month."
      8. After 3 months: 2 term sheets arrive within a week of each other. 
         Negotiates and closes with better-fit investor at $1.6M.
    outcome: |
      Closed $1.6M pre-seed in 4 months starting from zero network. Built 
      relationships with 30+ investors for future rounds. Key learning: 
      network can be built, just takes hustle and authenticity.
    lessons:
      - "You can build a network from scratch - it just takes more work"
      - "Practice on Tier 2/3 before Tier 1 - refine your pitch"
      - "Cold outreach works if personalized (10-15% response rate realistic)"
      - "Existing angels are best intro source - they want you to succeed"
      - "Create soft urgency - multiple interested investors help"
      - "First-time founders do raise - traction and hustle matter"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Experienced founder running tight process"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: "30-person Series A company, founder has raised before, raising $15M Series B"
    situation: |
      James (CEO, second-time founder) is raising Series B. He raised Series A 
      two years ago and learned a lot from that process. This time, he wants 
      to run a tighter process: faster, more competitive, better terms. He 
      has existing investor relationships but knows Series B is different - 
      larger checks, more scrutiny, fewer leads.
    trigger: "Strong metrics (3x growth), existing investors want to preempt, but James wants to run a process"
    actions: |
      1. James resists preemptive term sheet from existing investor. "Thank 
         you, but I want to run a process. If you're still interested in 
         4 weeks, let's talk." Creates leverage.
      2. Runs tighter research: identifies 30 Series B funds (fewer but 
         higher quality). Each must have led $10-20M rounds in his sector.
      3. Preps materials aggressively: updated deck, 3-year model, data room 
         ready BEFORE first meeting. No scrambling during process.
      4. Coordinates intro timing: asks all intro sources to make intros in 
         same week. Creates compressed schedule: all first meetings in 2 weeks.
      5. During first meetings, sets expectations: "We're running a 6-week 
         process, aiming to have term sheets by [date]." Professional and 
         transparent.
      6. After first meetings: 8 investors want second meetings. Schedules 
         all partner meetings in 1 week. Parallel tracks customer references 
         and DD.
      7. Creates competition: 3 term sheets arrive within days of each other. 
         Shares timeline: "We'll make a decision by Friday."
      8. Negotiates key terms (valuation, board seat, pro-rata) with leverage 
         of multiple offers. Closes at $18M on strong terms in 5 weeks.
    outcome: |
      Raised $18M Series B in 5 weeks (vs. 4 months for Series A). Strong 
      terms due to competitive process. Key learning: preparation and 
      timing discipline creates leverage.
    lessons:
      - "Resisting preemptive offers can create better outcomes"
      - "Compressed timeline = leverage (less time for cold feet)"
      - "Preparation before process starts is key - no scrambling"
      - "Coordinate intro timing to batch first meetings"
      - "Set clear timeline expectations upfront"
      - "Multiple term sheets simultaneously = negotiating power"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Fundraise in difficult market"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: "50-person Series A company, market has turned (2022-style), raising Series B but environment is tough"
    situation: |
      Sofia (CEO) is raising Series B but the market has shifted. Growth 
      equity has pulled back, valuations are down 40%, and investors are 
      focused on profitability. Her company grew 2x last year (good, not 
      exceptional) and is burning $400K/month. Existing investors are 
      supportive but cautious. She's hearing "come back when you're 
      profitable" from investors who would have competed for the deal a 
      year ago.
    trigger: "12 months runway, need to raise or cut significantly"
    actions: |
      1. Sofia acknowledges market reality: this raise will be harder than 
         expected. Adjusts expectations on valuation (flat to down round 
         possible) and timeline (6+ months).
      2. Restructures pitch for new environment: de-emphasizes growth, 
         emphasizes unit economics, path to profitability, capital 
         efficiency. New narrative: "We can be profitable in 12 months 
         if needed."
      3. Expands investor list: includes growth equity AND earlier-stage 
         investors who might write larger checks. Also adds strategic 
         investors and family offices (different criteria).
      4. Creates leverage by reducing burn: cuts 20% of team, extends 
         runway to 18 months. Message to investors: "We don't NEED to 
         raise, we WANT to accelerate."
      5. First meetings reveal new objections: "We're not doing new deals" 
         "Come back when profitable" "Valuation expectations need to reset."
         Sofia listens and adjusts.
      6. Finds investors still active: growth-stage generalists and 
         sector-focused funds. Narrows focus to 15 realistic leads.
      7. After 5 months: 2 term sheets, both below last-round valuation. 
         Negotiates structure (non-dilutive elements, tranching) to make 
         terms work. Board discusses and approves.
      8. Closes at flat valuation with $12M. Not the outcome hoped for, 
         but company survives and can prove profitability path.
    outcome: |
      Raised $12M Series B in 6 months despite tough market. Flat round 
      (not ideal) but company survived. Cut team and extended runway 
      created leverage. Key learning: adapt to market, create optionality.
    lessons:
      - "Market conditions matter - adjust expectations"
      - "Pitch must match the moment (efficiency > growth in down markets)"
      - "Cutting burn creates leverage ('we don't need to raise')"
      - "Expand investor universe when traditional sources dry up"
      - "Flat or down round is better than death"
      - "Timeline extends in tough markets - start earlier"
      - "Listen to objections and adapt the story"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Can't get meetings"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Work network harder, expand intro sources, improve cold outreach, 
        consider accelerator or advisor relationships. If no one will meet, 
        may have positioning or traction problem.
        
    - risk: "Meetings don't convert"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Get feedback on why (ask investors directly). Usually pitch, 
        valuation, or timing. Refine deck and story. Practice with 
        friendly investors first.
        
    - risk: "Process takes too long"

        Create soft deadlines, batch meetings, expand list, lower bar on 
        investor quality if needed. Consider bridge from existing investors.
        
    - risk: "Only one term sheet"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Less leverage but not fatal. Negotiate firmly on key terms. 
        Consider walking if terms are bad. One offer is still an offer.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "CEO distracted, company suffers"
      impact: |
        Execution drops during fundraise. Metrics worsen. Investors 
        notice. Vicious cycle: need to raise because distracted, 
        distracted because raising.
      prevention: |
        Strong co-founder or COO to run company. Set "CEO available" 
        hours and protect the rest. Batch meetings to reduce context 
        switching. Accept some execution drop but minimize.
        
    - risk: "Team morale drops"
      impact: |
        Team knows fundraising is hard. Uncertainty creates anxiety.
        People may start looking for other jobs.
      prevention: |
        Communicate transparently (without oversharing). Show confidence 
        even when hard. Celebrate milestones. Have backup plan visible 
        ("even if we don't raise, we have 18 months").
