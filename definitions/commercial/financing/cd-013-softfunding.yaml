definition:
  purpose: |
    Softfunding refers to non-dilutive capital: grants, tax credits, 
    subsidized loans, and other government or institutional funding 
    that does not require giving up equity. For technology startups, 
    particularly in R&D-intensive sectors, softfunding can provide 
    meaningful runway extension without dilution.
    
    Common softfunding sources:
    - R&D tax credits (US, UK, Canada, EU, Norway, etc.)
    - Government grants (SBIR/STTR in US, Innovate UK, EU Horizon)
    - Regional development grants
    - Industry-specific programs (energy, healthcare, defense)
    - Academic partnerships with funded research
    - Accelerator grants (non-equity or minimal equity)
    
    Why softfunding matters:
    - Non-dilutive: keeps founder and investor equity intact
    - Validates: grant approvals signal external validation
    - Extends runway: reduces amount of equity capital needed
    - Access: opens doors to government and institutional networks
    
    Tradeoffs and realities:
    - Time-intensive: applications take significant effort
    - Uncertain: approval rates vary widely
    - Compliance: grants come with reporting requirements
    - Timing: funding cycles may not match company needs
    - Strings: some grants restrict use of funds
    
  outcome: |
    Non-dilutive capital that extends runway, reduces equity needs, 
    and provides external validation. Clear understanding of applicable 
    programs and realistic assessment of effort vs. return.

    name: "First-Time Founder Discovering SkatteFUNN"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      Norwegian startup, 5 people, pre-seed. Building AI product. 
      Founder heard about SkatteFUNN from another founder. Has not 
      claimed any R&D incentives before.
    situation: |
      Company has been spending on product development for 18 months. 
      Runway is tight. Founder wants to understand if SkatteFUNN 
      could help without taking too much time from product work.
    trigger: |
      Fellow founder mentioned receiving significant SkatteFUNN 
      refund. CEO wants to investigate if it applies.
    actions: |
      1. Researched SkatteFUNN basics: 19% of eligible R&D costs 
         (up to 25M NOK), requires Research Council approval, 
         must apply before project starts (can cover past year work).
      2. Assessed eligibility: company qualifies as SME, work 
         involves technical uncertainty (AI model development, 
         novel algorithms), project has defined scope.
      3. Contacted accountant to confirm no conflicts and understand 
         documentation requirements.
      4. Drafted SkatteFUNN project application describing technical 
         challenges, innovation approach, personnel, and budget.
      5. Submitted application to Research Council portal before 
         deadline (September for following year).
      6. Set up simple time tracking for R&D personnel to capture 
         hours on approved project.
      7. Application approved. Began tracking eligible costs.
      8. At year-end, submitted claim through tax return. Received 
         refund of approximately 500K NOK.
    outcome: |
      First SkatteFUNN claim successful. 500K NOK refund extended 
      runway by 3 months. Process took approximately 40 hours total 
      (application, tracking, claim). Established annual process for 
      ongoing claims.
    lessons:
      - Start SkatteFUNN early - application before work begins
      - Time tracking is essential for documentation
      - Accountant relationship helps with process
      - ROI is excellent if you are doing qualifying R&D

    name: "CEO Building US SBIR Strategy"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: |
      US healthcare technology company, 12 people, Series Seed. 
      Product involves medical AI. Board suggested exploring SBIR 
      given healthcare focus and R&D intensity.
    situation: |
      Company has $2M runway and will need to raise Series A in 
      12-18 months. Board wants to understand if SBIR could provide 
      non-dilutive funding to extend runway.
    trigger: |
      Board member with healthcare experience mentioned that similar 
      companies had received significant SBIR funding from NIH.
    actions: |
      1. Researched SBIR program: Phase I ($275K, 6-9 months) and 
         Phase II ($2M, 2 years). NIH has 24 institutes with 
         different focuses. 10-20% win rate depending on institute.
      2. Identified relevant NIH institutes: NIBIB (biomedical 
         imaging and bioengineering), NCI (cancer), and NCATS 
         (translational sciences).
      3. Reviewed recent NIH SBIR awards in our domain to understand 
         what gets funded and typical project scopes.
      4. Contacted program officers at relevant institutes to discuss 
         fit (encouraged for NIH SBIR).
      5. Developed Phase I proposal focusing on AI validation study 
         that aligned with company roadmap.
      6. Hired SBIR consultant ($5K) to review proposal and improve 
         Specific Aims and Research Strategy sections.
      7. Submitted to NIH NIBIB. Waited 6 months for review.
      8. Received score but not funded (score 38, needed <25). 
         Reviewed feedback, identified weaknesses.
      9. Revised and resubmitted for next cycle. Second submission 
         funded with Phase I award.
    outcome: |
      Phase I award received on second attempt. $275K non-dilutive 
      funding. Project validated AI approach and generated data for 
      Series A. Total effort approximately 200 hours across two 
      submissions.
    lessons:
      - SBIR takes time and persistence
      - Talk to program officers before submitting
      - First submission often does not fund but provides feedback
      - Consultant can improve proposal significantly

    organization_context: |
      Climate tech company, 50 people, Series B. Operations in US 
      and UK. Significant R&D spend. Ad-hoc softfunding efforts have 
      been successful but inefficient.
    situation: |
      Company has received various grants and tax credits over years, 
      but approach has been opportunistic. CEO wants CFO to 
      professionalize and scale softfunding to capture more value.
    trigger: |
      Financial planning revealed that R&D credits were under-claimed 
      by estimated 40% due to poor documentation and missed programs.

      1. Audited current state: US R&D credit claimed at minimal 
         level, UK R&D relief not claimed for 2 years, multiple 
         grant opportunities missed.
      2. Mapped all applicable programs across US and UK: federal 
         and state R&D credits, SBIR (DOE focus for climate tech), 
         Innovate UK Smart Grants, UK R&D relief.
      3. Engaged specialized R&D credit firm for both US and UK. 
         Fee: percentage of credits recovered. Firm identified 
         additional $350K in missed credits from prior years.
      4. Built internal process: Engineering manager responsible for 
         project documentation, Finance tracks eligible spend, 
         quarterly review of new opportunities.
      5. Created grant calendar: DOE SBIR/STTR twice yearly, 
         Innovate UK windows, state programs.
      6. Hired part-time grants coordinator (0.5 FTE) to manage 
         pipeline and prepare applications with engineering input.
      7. Established compliance system: separate GL codes for grant 
         expenses, reporting calendar, documentation standards.
      8. First year results: $550K in R&D credits claimed (up from 
         $180K), $400K in grants awarded, $350K in prior year 
         credits recovered.
    outcome: |
      Softfunding program now generates $1M+ annually in non-dilutive 
      funding. ROI on 0.5 FTE plus consultant fees exceeds 5x. 
      Process runs systematically with clear ownership and metrics.
    lessons:
      - Prior year credits can often be recovered
      - Specialists pay for themselves in complex programs
      - Dedicated ownership drives consistent results
      - Documentation is the key constraint

operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - R&D activities that may qualify for credits/grants
    - Basic financial record-keeping
    - Understanding of applicable jurisdictions
    - Time or resources to pursue applications
    
  common_blockers:
    - "Too busy to apply - Start with R&D credits, they are annual anyway"
    - "Not sure if we qualify - Most tech companies qualify for something"
    - "Applications seem too hard - Start with simpler programs"
    - "Not worth the time - Track ROI, often very positive"
    
  integration_points:
    - Revenue Modeling: Include softfunding in runway projections
    - R&D Planning: Align grant applications with roadmap
    - Finance: Track eligible expenses, process claims
    - Legal: IP considerations for some grants

risks:
  if_skipped: |
    Leave non-dilutive funding on the table. Raise more equity than 
    needed. Miss validation opportunity. Competitors who use 
    softfunding have longer runway.
    
  if_over_engineered: |
    Spend too much time on low-probability grants. Distract from core 
    business. Take on grants with burdensome compliance. Build 
    dependency on uncertain funding.
