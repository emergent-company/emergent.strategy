# Rationale for placement: Fundraising is investor acquisition, which belongs in 
# Commercial. This is the coordinating process that orchestrates the sub-activities:
# - cd-010: Investor pitch decks
# - cd-011: Roadshows and outreach  
# - cd-012: Term sheet negotiations
# - cd-013: Softfunding
# Once capital is raised, ongoing investor relations moves to OrgOps.

  purpose: |
    Most startups need to raise capital. A disorganized fundraise takes 
    longer, results in worse terms, and distracts from building. A 
    prepared, organized process maximizes outcome and minimizes time.
    
  outcome: |
    Capital is raised on good terms. Process is efficient. 
    Relationships are built. Company can return to execution 
    quickly. Investor is a good partner.

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "First-time founder raising Seed round"
    practitioner: "CEO / First-time Founder"
    organization_context: "4-person pre-seed startup, $100K ARR, raising $2M Seed"
    situation: |
      Sam is a first-time founder with strong product skills but no VC network. The 
      company has early traction ($100K ARR, growing 20% MoM) but only 3 months runway. 
      Sam has heard fundraising takes 6 months and is panicking. A founder friend 
      suggested "start with tier 2 VCs to practice" but Sam isn't sure which are tier 2.
    trigger: "Runway alarm: 3 months left, need to start raise now"
    actions: |
      1. Sam asks 3 advisor friends which VCs to target. Gets list of 25 names with 
         notes on fit, check size, and intro paths. Researches each fund's portfolio.
      2. Builds target list in Notion: 25 firms, ranked by fit and intro strength. 
         Maps every possible warm intro path. Identifies 5 "cold" targets to practice on.
      3. Spends 10 days on materials: rewrites deck 4 times (gets feedback from 2 founders 
         who raised successfully). Builds simple 3-year model. Creates DocSend data room.
      4. Sends deck to 5 "practice" investors first. Gets feedback: "Your traction slide 
         is buried, lead with it." Revises deck. Gains confidence from meetings.
      5. Activates warm intros to top 10 targets. Sends personalized notes for each 
         (references their portfolio, why specific fit). 7 respond, 6 take first meeting.
      6. Over 4 weeks: conducts 15 first meetings, gets 4 partner meetings, receives 
         2 term sheets. Creates urgency: "I need to make a decision by Friday."
      7. Negotiates between 2 term sheets. Gets valuation improved 10% by creating 
         competition. Chooses investor based on partnership quality (better references), 
         not highest valuation.
    outcome: |
      Raised $2M at $10M post. Process took 10 weeks including prep. Key learning: 
      warm intros were 10x more effective than cold outreach. The "practice" meetings 
      were valuable - first version of deck wasn't good enough.
    lessons:
      - "Map warm intro paths first - they convert 10x better than cold"
      - "Get deck feedback from founders who've raised successfully"
      - "Practice with less critical targets before dream investors"
      - "Create urgency with multiple term sheets - competition improves terms"
      - "Choose investor on partnership quality, not just valuation"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Raising Series A with mixed signals"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: "22-person Series A company, $2M ARR but flat growth, 8 months runway"
    situation: |
      Jenny's company grew fast initially but has plateaued at $2M ARR for 6 months. 
      The team found product-market fit in one segment but struggled to expand. 
      Investors will ask about the flat growth. Jenny has 8 months runway - enough 
      to raise, but the story is complicated. Board is pushing to "just get it done."
    trigger: "Board meeting: 'We need to start the Series A now - runway is getting tight'"
    actions: |
      1. Jenny acknowledges the challenge: flat growth is a red flag. Works with board 
         to craft the narrative: "We found PMF in segment A, got distracted trying to 
         expand, refocused, now seeing early signs of renewed growth."
      2. Decides to wait 6 weeks before starting outreach: uses time to show 2 months 
         of positive growth trajectory (even if small). Extends runway by cutting burn.
      3. Builds deck that directly addresses the objection: includes a slide on 
         "What we learned" that honestly discusses the plateau and the fix.
      4. Targets investors who value learning and focus over hypergrowth. Avoids funds 
         that only invest in "up and to the right" stories.
      5. First 8 meetings: gets tough questions about growth. Refines answers. Realizes 
         some investors won't get past it - stops pursuing those, focuses on warmer leads.
      6. After 12 meetings, 2 VCs remain interested. One appreciates the honest learning 
         narrative; the other is skeptical but still engaged.
      7. Gets term sheet from the VC who valued learning. Valuation is lower than hoped 
         ($20M vs $25M) but clean terms and good partner.
    outcome: |
      Raised $8M at $20M valuation. Took 14 weeks (longer than hoped). Key learning: 
      honesty about the plateau, combined with showing a fix, worked better than trying 
      to spin the data. The VCs who were right for the company appreciated the maturity.
    lessons:
      - "Address objections head-on in the deck - investors will find out anyway"
      - "Show the fix, not just the problem - 'we learned and adapted'"
      - "Target investors who match your stage and situation"
      - "Valuation isn't everything - partner quality and terms matter"
      - "Extending runway before raising gives more options and leverage"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Navigating a down round / bridge"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: "60-person startup, raised $15M Series A at $60M, now needs capital but metrics don't support Series B"
    situation: |
      Mike's company raised Series A at $60M valuation in a hot market. 18 months later, 
      the market has cooled, revenue is $5M (was projecting $10M), and they have 6 
      months runway. A Series B at clean terms is unlikely - VCs would need to invest 
      at $30-40M to hit their return targets, but existing investors have rights at 
      $60M. Mike faces the dreaded conversation: down round, bridge, or restructure.
    trigger: "Lead Series A investor says 'you're not ready for B - let's discuss options'"
    actions: |
      1. Mike gets honest with himself and the board: Series B at good terms isn't 
         happening. Options are: (a) down round from new investor, (b) bridge from 
         existing investors, (c) get profitable fast, (d) sell the company.
      2. Works with lawyer to understand existing term sheet: participating preferred, 
         anti-dilution, founder vesting. A true down round would hit founders hard.
      3. Explores bridge from existing investors: they're willing to bridge at last 
         round valuation (converts to next round) with modest interest. This preserves 
         founder equity better than down round.
      4. Negotiates bridge terms: $3M bridge, 12-month runway, milestones for conversion. 
         Investors add requirement: cut burn 30% and hit $7M ARR before Series B.
      5. Announces layoffs (painful but necessary), refocuses product on core segment 
         that's working, sets aggressive but achievable milestones.
      6. Uses bridge period to rebuild momentum. 10 months later, hits $8M ARR with 
         better unit economics. Market sentiment has improved.
      7. Raises Series B at $55M (technically flat, practically a good outcome). 
         Founder equity intact. Lesson delivered on capital efficiency.
    outcome: |
      Survived the "valley of death" through bridge + restructure. Series B raised 
      at flat valuation felt like a win given the alternative. Key learning: existing 
      investors preferred bridge over losing their investment entirely.
    lessons:
      - "Existing investors often prefer bridge over down round - ask"
      - "Get honest about situation early - denial makes options worse"
      - "Bridge should come with clear milestones - not just runway"
      - "Sometimes the right answer is to cut and focus, not keep raising"
      - "Anti-dilution and preferences matter more in bad outcomes"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Running out of runway during raise"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Start raising with 6+ months runway. Have backup plan (bridge from existing, 
        revenue acceleration, cost cuts). Monitor burn carefully during raise. Know 
        your "drop dead" date and work backward.
        
    - risk: "No term sheets after 3+ months of meetings"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Get feedback after rejections - pattern will emerge. May need to adjust 
        ask (lower valuation, smaller round), improve metrics, or pivot target 
        investors. Consider bridge from existing investors while improving position.
        
    - risk: "CEO distraction tanks company performance during raise"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Fundraising is the CEO's job, but company must keep running. Delegate 
        operations to COO/team. Set specific "CEO office hours" for non-fundraising. 
        Keep weekly metrics tracking. Don't let the raise become an excuse.
        
    - risk: "Taking bad terms due to desperation"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Understand term sheet terms before negotiating (liquidation preference, 
        anti-dilution, board seats). Get lawyer review. Compare to market standards. 
        Sometimes walking away is better than terrible terms.
        
    - risk: "Wrong investor - misaligned expectations or style"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Do reference checks on investors (call their portfolio CEOs, including 
        ones that didn't work out). Assess style match in meetings. Ask about 
        how they handle tough times. Evaluate board member specifically.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Failing to raise leads to shutdown or fire sale"
      impact: |
        Without capital, company may need to shut down, sell for parts, or do 
        a desperate bridge that wipes out founders and early employees. The 
        reputation hit affects everyone's next venture.
      prevention: |
        Start raising early (6+ months runway). Have backup options identified. 
        Maintain investor relationships before you need them. Consider 
        profitability path as alternative to raising.
        
    - risk: "Over-dilution from repeated down rounds"
      impact: |
        Founders and early employees can lose motivation if equity becomes 
        nearly worthless. Team attrition accelerates. The company becomes 
        hard to recruit for. Subsequent raises become harder.
      prevention: |
        Raise the right amount (not too much leads to high valuations you can't 
        justify next round). Hit milestones promised to investors. Bridge at 
        flat terms rather than true down round when possible.
        
    - risk: "Adversarial board after difficult raise"
      impact: |
        New investors with aggressive terms may become adversarial board members 
        - pushing for outcomes that benefit their terms rather than company 
        success. Founders lose control of key decisions.
      prevention: |
        Choose investors carefully (check references). Understand board seat 
        implications. Negotiate protective provisions carefully. Build 
        relationship with individual board member, not just fund.

# Domain Context - Industry Best Practices and Benchmarks
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Startup fundraising is cyclical and sentiment-driven. The 2020-2021 period saw 
    record valuations and fast rounds; 2022-2024 brought correction with down rounds, 
    bridges, and longer processes. The fundamentals matter more now: growth, unit 
    economics, path to profitability.
    
    Key shifts: (1) Profitability path matters more than growth-at-all-costs, (2) Due 
    diligence is more rigorous - investors are burned by overvalued companies, (3) 
    Valuation expectations have reset - compare to 2019 multiples, not 2021, (4) 
    "Secondaries" (existing investor sales) are more common, (5) Bridge rounds and 
    flat rounds are more acceptable than before.
    
    For founders: the bar is higher, but good companies still get funded. Preparation 
    matters more. Warm intros matter more. Having multiple options creates leverage.

  best_practices:
    - "Start with 6+ months runway - desperation kills negotiating power"
    - "Map warm intro paths first - cold outreach converts poorly"
    - "Get deck feedback from founders who've raised recently"
    - "Practice with 2-3 lesser-priority investors before dream targets"
    - "Create momentum and urgency - parallel process, tight timelines"
    - "Reference check investors - call portfolio CEOs (especially failed ones)"
    - "Understand term sheets before negotiating - lawyer review essential"
    - "Choose investor on partnership quality, not just valuation"
    
  anti_patterns:
    - "Spray and pray: mass cold email to 200 VCs (signals desperation)"
    - "No warm intros: relying entirely on cold outreach"
    - "Starting too late: 3 months runway when beginning raise"
    - "Overselling: promising metrics you can't deliver"
    - "Ignoring terms: focusing only on valuation, accepting toxic terms"
    - "Not doing references: assuming VC brand means good partner"
    - "Losing momentum: long gaps between meetings, no urgency"
    - "Going dark: disappearing after investor questions instead of responding"
