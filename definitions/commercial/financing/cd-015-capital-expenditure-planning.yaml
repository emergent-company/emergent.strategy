definition:
  purpose: |
    Capital expenditure (capex) planning is about answering: "What big 
    investments do we need to make to grow, and when?" Unlike operating 
    expenses that are consumed immediately, capital expenditures are 
    investments in long-term assets - equipment, software, infrastructure - 
    that support future growth.
    
    For startups, capex decisions are particularly consequential because:
    - Cash is limited and capex ties up cash for extended periods
    - Wrong investments can't easily be reversed
    - Under-investment can create growth bottlenecks
    - Over-investment can extend runway unnecessarily
    
    Capex planning also affects financial reporting. Capitalized expenses 
    are depreciated over time rather than expensed immediately, which 
    affects profitability metrics and tax planning.
    
    Warning signs of missing capex planning:
    - Reactive purchasing (buying when something breaks)
    - No visibility into upcoming major expenses
    - Cash crunches from unexpected large purchases
    - Technical debt from avoiding infrastructure investment
    - Lease vs. buy decisions made ad hoc
    
  outcome: |
    A forward-looking capex plan that anticipates major investments, aligns 
    spending with growth objectives, optimizes cash usage, and supports 
    clear approval processes for significant purchases.

practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "First-Time CEO Building First Capex Plan"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      15-person Series A startup. Never had a formal capex plan. CFO 
      just joined and is introducing financial discipline. Board wants 
      visibility into how capital will be used.
    situation: |
      Company has been buying things ad hoc. No visibility into upcoming 
      major expenses. Board asked for capex plan as part of annual budget. 
      CEO realizes some big expenses are coming (office expansion, new 
      servers) but hasn't thought through timing or priorities.
    trigger: |
      Board meeting in 6 weeks. New CFO asked for capex input for 
      annual budget.
    actions: |
      1. Met with each department lead for 30 minutes to inventory 
         current assets and upcoming needs. IT had list of aging 
         equipment. Ops knew office lease was up in 8 months.
      2. Compiled needs list: 12 laptops ($24K), server refresh ($40K), 
         office buildout ($150K), new CRM ($30K), security upgrade ($15K).
      3. Classified each item: laptops (maintenance), servers (growth), 
         office (strategic), CRM (efficiency), security (must-do).
      4. Created ROI analysis for CRM (payback: 18 months from 
         efficiency gains) and servers (required for product roadmap).
      5. Built simple budget: $260K total capex for year. Spread by 
         quarter based on timing needs.
      6. Established approval process: under $10K = CEO, over $10K = 
         board notification, over $50K = board approval.
      7. Presented to board: "Here's what we need to spend, when, and 
         why." Board approved with minor adjustments.
    outcome: |
      First formal capex plan completed. Board praised the visibility. 
      Avoided cash crunch by planning office buildout around fundraising 
      timing. Discovered server refresh could be delayed 6 months by 
      optimizing current setup. Saved $40K in year one.
    lessons:
      - Simple capex plan beats no plan
      - Departments have visibility into needs you don't
      - Timing flexibility exists if you plan ahead
      - Board appreciates visibility even for obvious spending

    name: "CFO Managing Capex During Cash Crunch"
    practitioner: "CFO"
    organization_context: |
      60-person startup between funding rounds. Runway is 8 months. 
      Original capex budget assumed fundraise would close 3 months ago. 
      Need to preserve cash while maintaining operations.
    situation: |
      Original capex plan included $400K of spending. Fundraise delayed. 
      CEO and board want to extend runway. CFO needs to find capex cuts 
      without breaking the business.
    trigger: |
      Board emergency meeting to discuss runway extension. CFO asked 
      to present revised capex plan within a week.
    actions: |
      1. Pulled original capex plan and classified each item: must-have 
         vs. nice-to-have vs. deferrable.
      2. Identified $250K that could be deferred without immediate 
         business impact: office expansion ($150K), new tooling ($50K), 
         furniture ($30K), discretionary upgrades ($20K).
      3. Analyzed $150K that felt essential: security compliance ($40K), 
         laptop replacements ($30K), server capacity ($80K).
      4. Worked with IT on server capacity: found cloud option that 
         converted $80K capex to $15K/month opex. Preserved cash now, 
         higher total cost but survives to fundraise.
      5. Negotiated with security vendor: spread $40K over 6 months 
         instead of upfront payment.
      6. For laptops: implemented repair program instead of replacement. 
         Deferred $20K of $30K.
      7. Revised capex to $50K for next 6 months, down from $200K 
         originally planned. Added back $150K contingent on close.
      8. Presented revised plan with clear trade-offs: "Here's what 
         we're deferring, the risks, and trigger for spending if we 
         close round."
    outcome: |
      Extended runway by 6 weeks through capex cuts alone. Raised round 
      before runway exhausted. Post-raise, accelerated deferred capex. 
      Some deferred items turned out to be unnecessary (office expansion 
      became remote-first instead).
    lessons:
      - Capex is often more flexible than it appears
      - Opex alternatives can bridge capex timing gaps
      - Crisis reveals what's truly essential
      - Deferred spending sometimes disappears entirely

    name: "CEO Making Build vs Buy Decision for Core Infrastructure"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: |
      B2B SaaS company, 100 employees. Current data infrastructure is 
      limiting product development. Two options: build custom platform 
      ($500K capex + team) or buy/integrate commercial solution 
      ($200K/year SaaS + implementation).
    situation: |
      Engineering says custom build is technically superior but takes 
      18 months. Product says buy solution ships features in 6 months. 
      Finance needs to model total cost. Board will want to approve 
      either path.
    trigger: |
      CTO presented both options at leadership meeting. CEO needs to 
      make recommendation to board in 2 weeks.
    actions: |
      1. Assembled cross-functional team: CTO, Head of Product, CFO, 
         lead engineer. Goal: rigorous build vs. buy analysis.
      2. Defined requirements: must-haves, nice-to-haves, future needs. 
         Evaluated buy option against each.
      3. Modeled 5-year TCO: Build = $500K Y1 + $200K/year team + 
         maintenance = $1.3M. Buy = $200K/year + $100K integration + 
         $50K/year customization = $1.35M.
      4. Analyzed non-financial factors: Time to market (buy: 6mo, 
         build: 18mo), Control (build: full, buy: limited), Risk 
         (build: execution, buy: vendor).
      5. Calculated opportunity cost: 18-month delay in shipping 
         features = $2M in delayed revenue based on current trajectory.
      6. Evaluated vendor stability: vendor is well-funded, good 
         references, API allows future migration.
      7. Created decision framework: "Buy now to ship features, but 
         architect for potential future build if we hit limitations."
      8. Presented recommendation to board: buy solution with 
         milestone-based migration criteria.
    outcome: |
      Board approved buy recommendation. Shipped key features 5 months 
      ahead of build timeline. Revenue impact validated opportunity 
      cost analysis. Two years later, had not hit vendor limitations. 
      Saved $500K capex and 18 months of distraction.
    lessons:
      - TCO analysis is table stakes; opportunity cost is deciding factor
      - Build bias in engineering should be challenged with data
      - Buy with migration path is often best of both worlds
      - Time to market has real revenue implications
