definition:
  job_to_be_done: >
    When I'm searching for information across our knowledge base, I want to discover not just exact keyword matches 
    but also conceptually related content and understand how different pieces connect, so I can build comprehensive 
    understanding and find insights I didn't know existed.

  solution_approach: >
    A knowledge graph that understands meaning and relationships. When you search or explore, the system shows you 
    related entities, discovers connections across different content types, and helps you navigate through relationships. 
    It learns what things mean (not just what they're called) and shows you how different pieces of knowledge connect 
    to each other. Think of it like a map of your organization's knowledge where you can zoom in on details or zoom 
    out to see patterns, and the system suggests relevant connections you might not have thought to look for.

      description: >
        Find information by meaning, not just keywords. Search for "renewable energy investments" and discover 
        related content about "solar projects" and "green financing" even when different words are used.

      name: "Relationship Navigation"
      description: >
        Explore how different entities connect. See that a project depends on a supplier, which relates to 
        a contract, which references specific regulations. Follow these connections to build understanding.

        The system understands context. When viewing a project, see related risks, stakeholders, documents, 
        and dependencies automatically. The graph builds context so you don't have to.
