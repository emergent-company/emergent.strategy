  job_to_be_done: |
    When I'm starting a new project or feature,
    I want to quickly scaffold entity types and relationships from proven patterns,
    so I can focus on domain-specific work instead of schema design.

  solution_approach: |
    A template pack system that:
    - Bundles entity types, relationships, and sample data
    - Provides domain-specific packs (product development, risk management, etc.)
    - Enables one-click installation into projects
    - Supports custom pack creation and sharing
    - Includes versioning and dependency management

        Browses template marketplace for relevant packs. Previews pack contents

      technical_proficiency: 'basic'
      current_situation: >
        As a new team member joining the product organization, I face an overwhelming blank
        canvas when starting projects. I have no idea which entity types to create, what
        relationships make sense, or how experienced teams structure their work. Every project
        start involves hours of uncertainty and guesswork about schema design. I often create
        structures that I later realize are wrong, requiring painful migrations. Senior team
        members are too busy to guide me through setup, so I waste days on work that should
        take hours.
      transformation_moment: >
        The first time I browse the template packs marketplace, I find a "Product Development"
        pack that includes exactly the entity types I need: features, user stories, sprints,
        and releases with all the relationships pre-configured. One click installs everything.
        I open my project and see a complete, professional structure ready to use. What would
        have taken me days of uncertain experimentation was done in seconds with a proven
        pattern. The sample data shows me how everything connects.
      emotional_resolution: >
        I now start new projects with confidence instead of anxiety. Template packs give me
        a professional foundation that I can learn from while contributing value. I spend
        my time on actual work instead of schema design. Senior team members compliment my
        project structures because they follow the same patterns the organization has proven.
        I feel competent and productive from day one instead of struggling through months
        of learning through mistakes.

      technical_proficiency: 'advanced'
      current_situation: >
        As a solutions architect responsible for organizational standards, I watch teams
        reinvent the wheel every time they start similar projects. Each team creates their
        own entity types and relationships from scratch, leading to inconsistent structures
        that make cross-team collaboration painful. I have documented best practices, but
        documentation is read once and forgotten. Teams do not adopt standards because
        implementing them requires too much manual work. My carefully designed patterns
        exist only in documents, not in actual project structures.
      transformation_moment: >
        Using the template pack creation API, I export our most successful project structure
        into a versioned pack with proper dependencies and documentation. Publishing to the
        organizational marketplace makes it instantly available to all teams. Within a week,
        15 teams install the pack for new projects. I see my best practices actually used
        instead of just documented. When I improve the pack, teams receive updates automatically.
        My patterns now scale across the organization through code, not documents.
      emotional_resolution: >
        My architectural work finally has real impact. Teams adopt standards because installing
        a pack is easier than starting from scratch. Cross-team collaboration improved because
        everyone uses consistent structures. I spend less time in meetings explaining standards
        and more time improving them. The organization sees architecture as an enabler, not
        overhead. My expertise is codified into reusable assets that continue providing value
        even when I am not involved.

      technical_proficiency: 'intermediate'
      current_situation: >
        Managing multiple engineering teams means I constantly deal with inconsistent project
        structures that slow down collaboration. When engineers move between teams, they spend
        weeks learning new structures instead of contributing value. Code reviews reveal
        different teams using different patterns for the same concepts. I have tried mandating
        standards through documentation, but compliance is inconsistent and enforcement is
        manual. I lack visibility into which teams follow standards and which need help.
      transformation_moment: >
        After recommending specific template packs for different project types, I can see
        adoption rates across all teams in my department. Teams that install the recommended
        packs immediately have consistent structures. The pack compliance dashboard shows me
        exactly which teams need attention. Cross-team collaboration improves because everyone
        speaks the same structural language. New projects start with proven patterns instead
        of team-specific inventions.
      emotional_resolution: >
        Standardization is finally achievable without heavy-handed enforcement. Teams adopt
        standards because packs make it easier, not because I mandate it. Cross-team engineers
        are productive faster because structures are familiar. My department reviews show
        improved collaboration metrics and faster project starts. I spend leadership time on
        strategic decisions instead of structure debates. The organization recognizes my
        department as a model for how to scale best practices.

      current_situation: >
        Coordinating onboarding for dozens of new employees each quarter, I struggle with
        inconsistent experiences across teams. Some teams have excellent onboarding with
        clear structures and sample projects, while others throw new hires into confusing
        environments with no guidance. Training materials I create become outdated within
        months as teams evolve their structures. New hires in some teams are productive in
        weeks while others struggle for months, and the difference is largely random based
        on which team they join.
      transformation_moment: >
        Using template packs, I create standardized training environments that new hires
        use regardless of their eventual team. Every pack includes sample data and realistic
        scenarios for hands-on learning. New employees understand organizational structures
        through exploration before joining their teams. When packs update, training
        environments update automatically. The onboarding experience is consistent and
        high-quality for every new hire.
      emotional_resolution: >
        New hire time-to-productivity dropped dramatically and consistently across all teams.
        I receive compliments from managers about how prepared new employees are when they
        join. Training materials stay current because they are generated from living packs.
        I spend less time creating custom onboarding for each team and more time improving
        the overall program. HR leadership recognizes onboarding as a competitive advantage
        for recruiting, and template packs are a key part of that story.
