description: |
  EPF-Runtime is a headless workflow orchestration system that enables AI agents
  and humans to execute EPF methodology cycles programmatically. It provides
  durable workflow execution, schema validation, multi-tenancy, and deep
  integration with Emergent Core knowledge graph.

# WHY - Strategic Alignment (shared with emergent workspace)
alignment:
  north_star_reference: "../../READY/00_north_star.yaml"
  shared_strategy: true
  notes: |
    EPF-Runtime shares the Emergent workspace North Star: "Emergent understanding
    through properly connected, AI-enhanced information." Runtime enables this by
    making EPF methodology executable by machines, allowing AI agents to orchestrate
    product development cycles with structure and validation.

  EPF-Runtime is in early development. Initial focus is on core workflow
  orchestration (Layer 2) and API surface (Layer 1). Multi-tenancy and
  enterprise features (Layer 3) will be activated after core functionality
  is validated with early adopters.

  EPF-Runtime development follows the emergent workspace roadmap. Initial
  focus is on core workflow orchestration (L2) and API surface (L1) to
  enable early adopters (AI agents, DevOps engineers). Multi-tenancy (L3)
  and enterprise features (L4) will be activated after validating core
  value proposition with pilot customers.
  
  See ../../READY/05_roadmap_recipe.yaml for detailed quarterly OKRs and
