# Emergent: Executive Summary
**AI-Native Infrastructure for Knowledge Management**

---

## The Opportunity in 60 Seconds

**The Problem**: AI tools are smart but blind. 92% of developers use AI coding tools, but these tools lack organizational context—they don't know what teams are building or why.

**The Gap**: No one owns the "context layer" connecting strategy → knowledge → code for AI agents.

**Our Solution**: Emergent provides the intelligence layer that makes AI understand organizations through:
- **Emergent Core**: Knowledge engine with semantic search, knowledge graphs, and RAG-based AI chat
- **Emergent Frameworks**: Methodologies (like EPF) that structure strategy in machine-readable formats
- **Emergent Tools**: MCP integration exposing organizational context to AI agents

**Traction**: Validated 40%+ improvement in AI task completion rates when agents have Emergent context.

**Market**: $5-10B SAM for AI-augmented knowledge platforms, growing 20-30% annually.

**Ask**: Seed round to accelerate from beachhead (100 teams in 2025) to scale (5,000+ organizations by 2028).

## Product & Differentiation

### What We Build

**Emergent Core** (Flagship)
- Document ingestion from any source (URLs, files, integrations)
- Knowledge graphs with automatic entity extraction
- Semantic search (<200ms response, 10K+ objects)
- AI chat with source citations (verifiable, not hallucinatory)
- MCP server for AI agent integration

**Emergent Frameworks**
- EPF: Git-native strategy artifacts that AI can reason over
- OpenSpec: AI-assisted technical specifications

**Emergent Tools**
- MCP servers exposing context to Cursor, Claude, Copilot
- CLI and integration adapters

### Why We Win

**vs. Enterprise Solutions (Glean, Microsoft)**
- Developer-friendly API-first vs. enterprise-sales-first
- Cross-platform vs. ecosystem lock-in
- Transparent vs. black-box AI

**vs. Consumer Tools (NotebookLM)**
- "NotebookLM with the hood open"
- Configurable extraction, self-hostable, multi-tenant
- Full API access vs. no API
- Enterprise features vs. personal notebooks

**vs. Open-Source (Dify, Danswer, GraphRAG)**
- Productized knowledge graphs vs. flat search or libraries
- Managed service vs. DIY infrastructure
- Ecosystem integration (EPF, MCP) vs. standalone tools

### Our Moats
1. **MCP-First**: Early mover in AI agent protocol
2. **Knowledge Graph + Vector Hybrid**: Richer than pure RAG
3. **EPF Methodology**: Network effects as adoption grows
4. **Developer DNA**: Hard for enterprise tools to replicate
