# Emergent: One-Page Pitch

**AI Knowledge Infrastructure for Developer Teams**  
**Seed Round | $1-2M | December 2025**

---

## The Problem (30 seconds)

**85% of developers now use AI coding assistants** (Cursor, Copilot, Claude), but these tools are **context-blind**—they don't understand your product strategy, architecture decisions, or domain knowledge. Developers lose 20+ minutes per context switch searching Notion/Confluence. AI suggestions violate architecture patterns because the AI never read your ADRs. Onboarding takes weeks because tribal knowledge lives in senior engineers' heads.

**Current solutions fall short**:
- Notion AI/Confluence: Siloed within platform, no knowledge graph
- Google NotebookLM: Consumer-focused, not self-hostable, no API
- DIY RAG: Months of infrastructure work, requires AI/ML expertise
- Enterprise search (Glean): Enterprise-sales-first, proprietary lock-in

## The Solution (30 seconds)

**Emergent is AI knowledge infrastructure for technical teams.** We transform scattered documents (PDFs, markdown, URLs, integrations) into a **connected, queryable knowledge graph** that AI agents can reason over through the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

**Core Capabilities**:
1. **Document Intelligence**: Ingest from everywhere, chunk intelligently, extract entities
2. **Knowledge Graph**: Typed entities + relationships, configurable schema
3. **Hybrid Search**: Vector (semantic) + keyword + graph traversal
4. **AI Agent Integration**: MCP server for Claude, GPT, custom agents
5. **Multi-Tenant SaaS**: Org/project hierarchy, RBAC, self-service

**Key Differentiator**: "NotebookLM with the hood open"—self-hostable, configurable, API-first, with knowledge graph extraction (not just chat).

## Market Opportunity (20 seconds)

- **Target**: Technical product teams (5-50 engineers), AI-forward, documentation-heavy
- **TAM**: $15B (100K orgs globally @ $150K avg spend potential)
- **SAM**: $3B (20K AI-forward teams with knowledge management budget)
- **SOM (Year 3)**: $30M (500 customers @ $60K avg ARR)

**Timing**: AI assistants now mainstream (85% adoption), but context gap widely recognized. MCP ecosystem maturing. Knowledge infrastructure becoming expected part of AI toolchain.

---

## Business Model (20 seconds)

**Pricing Tiers**:
- Free: $0/month (100 docs, 1K queries, 3 users) → evaluation
- Team: $49/month per project (10K docs, unlimited queries, 10 users)
- Business: $199/month per project (unlimited, SSO, priority support)
- Enterprise: Custom (SLA, dedicated support, custom integrations)

**Unit Economics** (capital efficient):
- CAC: <$200 (developer-led growth, content marketing)
- LTV: >$2K (2-year avg retention)
- LTV:CAC: >10:1
- Payback: <6 months

**Growth**: Product-led (80%) + developer advocacy (20%)

---

## Traction (15 seconds)

**Product** *(Dec 2024)*:
- 10K+ documents ingested across customers
- 25K+ knowledge graph entities extracted
- 500+ MCP queries/week (Claude Desktop users)

**Business**:
- 3 paying design partners @ $500-1K/month each
- 15 active free tier projects
- $2K MRR (early stage)

**Key Learning**: MCP integration is killer feature—users see immediate value in AI conversations with organizational context.

---

## Competitive Moats (15 seconds)

1. **MCP-First Architecture**: Early mover in emerging standard; implementation know-how compounds
2. **Knowledge Graph + Vector Hybrid**: More sophisticated than pure RAG; requires AI/ML expertise
3. **Git-Native Strategy (EPF)**: Methodology creates network effects as adoption grows
4. **Developer DNA**: API-first, transparent, composable—cultural alignment hard for enterprise tools to replicate

---

## The Ask (15 seconds)

**Investment**: $1-2M seed round  
**Use of Funds** (18-month runway):
- 40% Engineering (3 engineers: 2 full-stack, 1 AI/ML)
- 30% Go-To-Market (developer advocate, content marketing)
- 20% Product/Design (1 designer, UX research)
- 10% Infrastructure (cloud costs, tools)

**Milestones**:
- Month 6: 100 customers, $10K MRR
- Month 12: 250 customers, $30K MRR, PMF validated
- Month 18: 500 customers, $60K MRR, Series A ready

## Team (10 seconds)

**Nikolai Rinas** - CEO & Founder
- 10+ years enterprise B2B SaaS experience
- CEO at eyedea, a software consultancy with 50+ client engagements
- Technical background: Full-stack engineer with AI/ML expertise
- Built Emergent to solve his own problem: enabling AI assistants to access organizational knowledge

**Why This Team**: Experienced the problem firsthand across consultancy projects; technical depth for sophisticated AI/ML product; B2B SaaS go-to-market experience; dogfooding Emergent with Emergent.

---

## Why Emergent Will Win (20 seconds)

**Timing**: MCP ecosystem emerging (early adopter advantage); NotebookLM proved consumer appeal, we're building enterprise version.

**Execution**: Knowledge graph + vector requires expertise; multi-tenant from day 1 hard to retrofit; quality of extraction differentiates.

**Capital Efficiency**: Developer-led growth, high LTV:CAC (>10:1), product-led model → reach profitability on seed capital.

**Ecosystem**: Not just Core—entire ecosystem (Core + Runtime + Tools) creates compounding value and network effects.
