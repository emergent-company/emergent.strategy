# ROADMAP Phase: Recipe for Solution
# This is the third sub-phase of READY where we create the actionable plan.
# 
# STRUCTURE: The roadmap is organized by TRACKS (Product, Strategy, Org/Ops, Commercial)
# to align with the four value models in the FIRE phase. Each track has its own OKRs,
# assumptions, and solution scaffold.
#
# KEY PRINCIPLE: Key Results (KRs) are the lowest level EPF defines. KRs are measurable
# milestones that are handed off to spec-driven development tools (Linear, Jira, etc.)
# which create work packages, tasks, and tickets for implementation.
#
# The roadmap defines WHAT outcomes we want and WHY (strategic traceability).
# Work packages define HOW we achieve those outcomes (implementation detail).
