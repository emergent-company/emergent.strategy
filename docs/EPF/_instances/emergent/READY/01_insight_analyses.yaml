## 1. TREND ANALYSIS: Where is the puck skating?

trends:
  technology:
    - trend: "LLM commoditization and RAG maturation"
      impact: "high"
      timeframe: "near term (1-2 years)"
      evidence:
        - "OpenAI, Anthropic, Google all offer competitive LLM APIs"
        - "RAG frameworks (LangChain, LlamaIndex) mainstream"
        - "Vector databases proliferating (Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector)"
      implications_for_us: |
        Raw LLM access is no longer a differentiator. Value shifts to 
        orchestration, data quality, and domain-specific grounding.
      implications_by_product:
        emergent_core: "Core's value is in knowledge graph quality, not just LLM wrapping"
        emergent_frameworks: "Frameworks can assume LLM availability; focus on structure/process"
        
    - trend: "AI agent architectures emerging"
      impact: "high"
      timeframe: "near term (1-2 years)"
      evidence:
        - "Model Context Protocol (MCP) by Anthropic gaining traction"
        - "Tool-using AI agents in production (Cursor, Copilot, Devin)"
        - "Enterprise interest in agentic workflows"
      implications_for_us: |
        MCP integration positions us as infrastructure for AI agents.
        Knowledge becomes consumable by external AI systems.
      implications_by_product:
        emergent_core: "MCP server exposes knowledge graphs to AI agents"
        epf_runtime: |
          AI agents need structured methodologies to execute reliably.
          Runtime provides programmatic API for autonomous EPF execution,
          enabling agents to run full product development cycles without
          manual intervention. This is the automation layer for agent-driven work.
        
    - trend: "Multi-modal AI capabilities expanding"
      impact: "medium"
      timeframe: "mid term (2-3 years)"
      evidence:
        - "GPT-4V, Gemini vision, Claude vision models"
        - "Document understanding improving (complex PDFs, tables)"
      implications_for_us: |
        Can extract from richer content types. Diagrams, charts, 
        slides become indexable alongside text.
      
  market:
    - trend: "Enterprise AI spending accelerating"
      impact: "high"
      timeframe: "near term"
      evidence:
        - "Gartner: AI software market growing 21% annually to $297B by 2027"
        - "Every enterprise tech vendor adding AI features"
        - "Budget shifting from 'experimentation' to 'implementation'"
      implications_for_us: |
        Money is available for solutions that prove value. 
        Must show clear ROI vs. generic AI tools.
      
    - trend: "Skepticism about AI value growing alongside hype"
      impact: "medium"

        - "Enterprise CIOs demanding proof points"
        - "Regulatory scrutiny increasing"
      implications_for_us: |
        Grounded, verifiable AI wins. Our source citation approach
        addresses this skepticism directly.
      
  user_behavior:
    - trend: "Expectation that AI understands organizational context"
      impact: "high"
      timeframe: "near term"

        - "Interest in 'bring your own data' AI solutions"
        - "Demand for enterprise-specific AI assistants"
      implications_for_us: |
        Users want AI that knows their domain. We provide the context
        layer that makes generic AI useful for specific organizations.
      
    - trend: "Developer-led adoption of AI infrastructure"
      impact: "high"
      timeframe: "near term"

        - "API-first products gaining over enterprise-sales-first"
      implications_for_us: |
        Our API-first approach aligns with how AI tools are adopted.
        Developer experience is a growth lever.
      
  regulatory:
    - trend: "AI governance and auditability requirements emerging"
      impact: "medium"
      timeframe: "mid term (2-4 years)"

        - "Enterprise governance boards requiring AI explainability"
        - "Industry-specific AI regulations (healthcare, finance)"
      implications_for_us: |
        Our source citation and traceability features become compliance 
        necessities, not just nice-to-haves. Competitive advantage.
      
  competitive:
    - trend: "Major platforms building knowledge management into AI"
      impact: "high"
      timeframe: "near term"
      evidence:
        - "Microsoft Copilot integrating with M365 content"
        - "Google Vertex AI with enterprise search"
        - "OpenAI adding retrieval and file handling"
      implications_for_us: |
        Can't compete on general search. Must differentiate on depth,
        developer control, and cross-platform capability.

key_insights:
  - "RAG + knowledge graphs are becoming table stakes, not differentiators—execution quality matters"
  - "The 'grounding problem' (making AI answers verifiable) is unsolved at enterprise scale"
  - "'Why now' = Enterprises ready to invest, but need solutions that actually work and can be trusted"
  - "MCP and agent architectures create new distribution channel for knowledge infrastructure"
  - "AI agents need structured methodologies: Generic LLMs can chat but struggle with multi-step strategic work requiring discipline, iteration, and traceability. EPF-Runtime addresses this by providing durable workflow orchestration for methodology execution."
