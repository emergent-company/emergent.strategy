  # STRATEGIC POSITIONING
  # ============================================================================
  
  positioning:
    unique_value_proposition: |
      Emergent is the intelligence layer that makes AI understand your organization.
      While AI tools see code, Emergent gives them the context—strategy, decisions,
      knowledge, and intent—that transforms generic AI into a team member who 
      actually knows your product.
    
    target_customer_profile: |
      Technical product teams (5-50 engineers) building complex software products.
      Specifically: Teams that are already AI-forward (using Cursor, Copilot, Claude),
      frustrated that these tools don't understand their product context, and 
      documentation-heavy enough to have a knowledge management problem worth solving.
      
      Initial beachhead: Software consultancies and product studios (like TwentyFirst,
      Eyedea) who work across multiple codebases and need knowledge transfer.
    
    category_position: "Creating a new category: AI Knowledge Infrastructure"
    
    positioning_statement: |
      For technical product teams who are frustrated that AI coding assistants
      don't understand their product context, Emergent is the knowledge infrastructure
      that connects strategy, documentation, and code into a unified context layer
      that AI agents can reason over—unlike Notion, Confluence, or raw ChatGPT,
      which treat knowledge as isolated documents rather than connected intelligence.
    
    tagline_candidates:
      - "The intelligence layer for AI-native development"
      - "Give your AI the context it's missing"
      - "Design by Emergence: invent the rules, discover the consequences"
      - "From scattered docs to connected intelligence"

    differentiation: |
      We're not building another AI search tool or document manager. We're building
      the infrastructure that connects the "why" (strategy) to the "what" (knowledge)
      to the "how" (code)—creating a unified context layer that AI agents can 
      reason over. Competitors own pieces; we own the connection.

      what_we_gain: "Fast feedback loops, product-led growth, cultural fit"
      what_we_give_up: "Faster enterprise revenue, larger deal sizes initially"

  # ============================================================================
  # STRATEGIC RISKS & MITIGATIONS
  # ============================================================================
  
  risks:
    - risk: "Big tech bundling (Microsoft Copilot, Google Vertex) commoditizes AI knowledge"
      likelihood: "high"
      impact: "high"
      mitigation: |
        Differentiate on cross-platform story, developer control, and open ecosystem.
        Be the Switzerland of AI knowledge—work with any AI provider, any platform.
        Move faster on MCP and agent infrastructure where bundlers are slow.
      monitoring: "Track bundling announcements; watch adoption patterns"
    
    - risk: "Well-funded competitors (Glean) move downmarket"
      likelihood: "medium"
      impact: "medium"
      mitigation: |
        Win on developer experience, not feature count. Glean's enterprise DNA
        makes it hard to serve developers well. Stay focused on technical teams.
      monitoring: "Track competitor pricing, product moves, developer sentiment"
    
    - risk: "DIY RAG solutions become too easy"
      likelihood: "high"
      impact: "medium"
      mitigation: |
        Value is in extraction quality, knowledge graph, and managed service—
        not just basic RAG. Build moat through methodology (EPF) and ecosystem (MCP).
        Consider open-sourcing core to capture DIY builders.
      monitoring: "Track LangChain, LlamaIndex adoption; new RAG tools"
    
    - risk: "MCP doesn't become the dominant AI agent protocol"
      likelihood: "low"
      impact: "medium"
      mitigation: |
        Support multiple protocols. MCP is a bet, but our value transcends any 
        single protocol. Knowledge graph and search work regardless of integration method.
      monitoring: "Track MCP adoption; watch for competing standards"
    
    - risk: "Team execution—too small to deliver on ambitious vision"
      likelihood: "medium"
      impact: "high"
      mitigation: |
        Focus ruthlessly on Phase 1. Hire strategically for leverage.
        Use AI tools to multiply output. Dogfood Emergent on Emergent.
      monitoring: "Velocity metrics; hiring pipeline; burn rate"
