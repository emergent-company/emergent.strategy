  # ============================================================================
  # 1. PURPOSE - Why We Exist
  # ============================================================================

  purpose:
    statement: |
      We help organizations achieve emergent understanding—insights from connections, not searches. We build tools that transform information chaos into self-organizing intelligence.

    problem_we_solve: |
      Organizations drown in unstructured information scattered across documents, URLs, and file systems. Critical knowledge is trapped in PDFs, meeting notes, and wikis—invisible to search, impossible to connect, lost when people leave. Teams spend hours hunting for information, making decisions on incomplete context. Beyond finding information, teams lack tools to synthesize understanding—to see emergent patterns when knowledge is connected.

    who_we_serve: 'Knowledge workers, product teams, and organizations who need to find, understand, connect, and act on information'

    impact_we_seek: |
      A world where organizational knowledge is alive—a self-organizing system where documents, entities, and relationships combine to create understanding greater than the sum of parts. Where AI assistants truly understand your domain through connected context and emergent insights surface automatically.

  # ============================================================================
  # 2. VISION - Where We Imagine Being in the Future
  # ============================================================================

  vision:
    vision_statement: |
      By 2028, Emergent powers thousands of organizations with AI-native knowledge management. Our Core engine and frameworks form the infrastructure for truly emergent organizational intelligence.

    timeframe: '2025-2030'

    success_looks_like:
      - "Emergent Core powers thousands of organizations' knowledge infrastructure"
      - 'AI assistants answer questions with citations grounded in organizational knowledge'
      - 'Knowledge graphs auto-emerge from unstructured content—building blocks form higher-level building blocks'
      - "Teams discover connections and insights they couldn't have predicted—emergent intelligence"
      - "The Emergent ecosystem becomes the 'intelligence layer' for enterprise AI"
      - 'Organizations experience Design by Emergence: invent the rules, discover the consequences'

    not_the_vision:
      - 'We are NOT a general-purpose search engine competing with Google'
      - 'We are NOT a document storage or file management system'
      - 'We are NOT building AI that replaces knowledge workers, but amplifies them'
      - 'We are NOT focused on consumer/personal knowledge management (Notion, Obsidian)'
      - 'We are NOT building one monolithic product—we build a composable ecosystem'

  # ============================================================================
  # 3. MISSION - What We Do to Deliver Value
  # ============================================================================

  mission:
    mission_statement: |
      We build AI-powered products and frameworks that help organizations achieve emergent understanding. Emergent Core ingests documents into knowledge graphs, enabling semantic search and AI chat grounded in sources.

    what_we_do:
      - 'Build AI-powered knowledge graphs from unstructured documents and URLs'
      - 'Enable hybrid semantic + full-text search over organizational knowledge'
      - 'Provide AI chat grounded in documents with source citations'
      - 'Expose knowledge via MCP for AI agent integration'
      - 'Execute structured product development workflows via EPF phases'

    how_we_deliver:
      approach: |
        We combine LLM extraction, embeddings, and RAG with graph-based knowledge representation. Documents become nodes connected by relationships, creating queryable knowledge graphs. Our products are API-first and composable.

      key_capabilities:
        - 'AI-powered document extraction and chunking with semantic understanding'
        - 'Vector embeddings + pgvector for semantic similarity search'
        - 'Typed knowledge graphs with Template Packs for domain modeling'
        - 'RAG-based chat with source grounding and citation'
        - 'Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for AI agents'
        - 'Multi-tenant architecture with fine-grained authorization'
        - 'Structured frameworks for product development and execution'

    who_we_serve_specifically: |
      Initially: Software teams, consultancies, and professional services firms who manage project knowledge and technical documentation. These teams have high information density and rely on knowledge for delivery. Later: Any knowledge-intensive organization—legal, healthcare, research—where finding and connecting information is critical.

    boundaries:
      we_dont_do:
        - 'Real-time collaboration/editing (not competing with Google Docs)'
        - 'Project management (not competing with Jira, Asana)'
        - 'General file storage/sync (not competing with Dropbox, Box)'
        - 'Consumer personal knowledge bases (not competing with Notion, Obsidian)'

      why_not: |
        Focus enables excellence. These adjacent categories are well-served by 
        mature products. Our differentiation is the AI-powered knowledge layer 
        that sits underneath or alongside these tools, making their content 
        searchable and connected.

  # ============================================================================
  # 4. VALUES - How We Behave and Conduct Ourselves
  # ============================================================================

  values:
    - value: 'Source of Truth'
      definition: |
        We believe in grounded AI—answers should be traceable to sources.
        Every response should link back to the documents that informed it.
        We build trust through transparency, not black-box magic.

      behaviors_we_expect:
        - 'AI responses always cite sources when making claims'
        - 'Users can verify any generated content against originals'
        - 'We log and trace AI decisions for debugging and improvement'

      behaviors_we_reject:
        - 'AI hallucinations presented as facts'
        - 'Answers without provenance or sources'
        - "Black-box processing where users can't understand why"

      example_decision: |
        We require RAG chat to include source citations even when it makes 
        responses longer. Users need to trust and verify AI outputs.

    - value: 'Incremental Value'
      definition: |
        Every piece of work should deliver measurable value quickly.
        We ship early, learn fast, and iterate based on real usage.
        Waiting for perfect is the enemy of good enough to learn.

      behaviors_we_expect:
        - 'Features ship incrementally with feedback loops'
        - 'MVPs that test core assumptions before full builds'
        - 'Telemetry and usage tracking to validate decisions'

      behaviors_we_reject:
        - 'Multi-month development cycles without user feedback'
        - 'Building features based on assumptions alone'
        - 'Perfectionism that delays learning'

      example_decision: |
        We shipped MCP integration as experimental before full documentation,
        learning from early adopters what actually mattered.

    - value: 'Developer Experience'
      definition: |
        We build tools we would want to use ourselves. APIs should be elegant,
        documentation should be complete, and errors should be helpful.
        A great DX reduces friction and enables rapid adoption.

      behaviors_we_expect:
        - 'Comprehensive API documentation with examples'
        - 'Meaningful error messages that guide resolution'
        - 'OpenAPI specs generated and kept current'

      behaviors_we_reject:
        - 'Undocumented or inconsistent APIs'
        - 'Errors that require source diving to understand'
        - 'Breaking changes without migration paths'

      example_decision: |
        We maintain generated OpenAPI specs and require scope documentation
        on every protected endpoint, even though it's extra work.

  value_conflicts:
    - tension: 'Speed vs. Quality (shipping fast vs. comprehensive testing)'
      resolution_principle: |
        Ship fast for feature discovery, quality for infrastructure. 
        New features can be experimental; auth/security cannot.
