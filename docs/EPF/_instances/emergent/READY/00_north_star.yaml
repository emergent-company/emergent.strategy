  # ============================================================================
  # 1. PURPOSE - Why We Exist
  # ============================================================================
  
  purpose:
    statement: |
      We exist to help knowledge workers and organizations achieve emergent understanding—
      insights that arise from connections, not just searches. Like emergence in nature,
      where simple building blocks following clear rules create complexity far greater than
      the sum of its parts, we build the tools, frameworks, and platforms that transform
      information chaos into self-organizing intelligence.
    
    problem_we_solve: |
      Organizations drown in unstructured information scattered across documents, URLs,
      and file systems. Critical knowledge is trapped in PDFs, meeting notes, and wikis—
      invisible to search, impossible to connect, and lost when people leave. Teams spend
      hours hunting for information that should be at their fingertips, making decisions
      on incomplete context, and duplicating work because they can't find what already exists.
      
      Beyond just finding information, teams lack the tools and methodologies to synthesize
      understanding across disparate sources—to see the emergent patterns that only appear
      when knowledge is connected and contextualized.
    
    who_we_serve: "Knowledge workers, product teams, and organizations who need to find, understand, connect, and act on information"
    
    impact_we_seek: |
      A world where organizational knowledge is alive—a self-organizing system
      where simple building blocks (documents, entities, relationships) combine
      through clear rules (extraction, connection, retrieval) to create understanding
      greater than the sum of its parts. Where AI assistants truly understand your
      domain because they reason over connected context. Where emergent insights
      surface automatically, revealing patterns humans couldn't predict.
  
  # ============================================================================
  # 2. VISION - Where We Imagine Being in the Future
  # ============================================================================
  
  vision:
    vision_statement: |
      By 2028, the Emergent ecosystem will power thousands of organizations with
      AI-native tools for knowledge management, product development, and strategic
      thinking. Our products—from the Core knowledge engine to specialized frameworks
      and tools—will form the invisible infrastructure that makes organizational
      intelligence truly emergent: insights that arise from connections, not just searches.
    
    timeframe: "3-5 years"
    
    success_looks_like:
      - "Emergent Core powers thousands of organizations' knowledge infrastructure"
      - "AI assistants answer questions with citations grounded in organizational knowledge"
      - "Knowledge graphs auto-emerge from unstructured content—building blocks form higher-level building blocks"
      - "Teams discover connections and insights they couldn't have predicted—emergent intelligence"
      - "The Emergent ecosystem becomes the 'intelligence layer' for enterprise AI"
      - "Organizations experience Design by Emergence: invent the rules, discover the consequences"
    
    not_the_vision:
      - "We are NOT a general-purpose search engine competing with Google"
      - "We are NOT a document storage or file management system"
      - "We are NOT building AI that replaces knowledge workers, but amplifies them"
      - "We are NOT focused on consumer/personal knowledge management (Notion, Obsidian)"
      - "We are NOT building one monolithic product—we build a composable ecosystem"
  
  # ============================================================================
  # 3. MISSION - What We Do to Deliver Value
  # ============================================================================
  
  mission:
    mission_statement: |
      We build an ecosystem of AI-powered products, frameworks, and tools that help
      organizations achieve emergent understanding. Our flagship product, Emergent Core,
      ingests documents, extracts entities into knowledge graphs, and enables semantic
      search and AI chat. Our frameworks codify best practices for product development.
      Together, they give organizations a queryable, connected understanding of everything
      they know—and the methodologies to act on that knowledge.

    how_we_deliver:
      approach: |
        We combine modern AI capabilities (LLM extraction, embeddings, RAG) with 
        graph-based knowledge representation. Documents become nodes, entities 
        become objects, and relationships connect them—creating a queryable 
        knowledge graph that AI assistants can reason over. Our products are 
        API-first and composable, enabling organizations to adopt what they need
        and integrate with existing tools.
      
      key_capabilities:
        - "AI-powered document extraction and chunking with semantic understanding"
        - "Vector embeddings + pgvector for semantic similarity search"
        - "Typed knowledge graphs with Template Packs for domain modeling"
        - "RAG-based chat with source grounding and citation"
        - "Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for AI agents"
        - "Multi-tenant architecture with fine-grained authorization"
        - "Structured frameworks for product development and execution"
    
    who_we_serve_specifically: |
      Initially: Software teams, consultancies, and professional services firms 
      who need to manage project knowledge, technical documentation, and client 
      information. These teams have high information density, rely on knowledge 
      for delivery, and are comfortable with technical products.
      
      Later: Any knowledge-intensive organization—legal, healthcare, research, 
      enterprise IT—where finding and connecting information is critical.
    
    boundaries:
      we_dont_do:
        - "Real-time collaboration/editing (not competing with Google Docs)"
        - "Project management (not competing with Jira, Asana)"
        - "General file storage/sync (not competing with Dropbox, Box)"
        - "Consumer personal knowledge bases (not competing with Notion, Obsidian)"
      
      why_not: |
        Focus enables excellence. These adjacent categories are well-served by 
        mature products. Our differentiation is the AI-powered knowledge layer 
        that sits underneath or alongside these tools, making their content 
        searchable and connected.
  
  # ============================================================================
  # 4. VALUES - How We Behave and Conduct Ourselves
  # ============================================================================
  
  values:
    - value: "Source of Truth"
      definition: |
        We believe in grounded AI—answers should be traceable to sources.
        Every response should link back to the documents that informed it.
        We build trust through transparency, not black-box magic.
      
      behaviors_we_expect:
        - "AI responses always cite sources when making claims"
        - "Users can verify any generated content against originals"
        - "We log and trace AI decisions for debugging and improvement"
      
      behaviors_we_reject:
        - "AI hallucinations presented as facts"
        - "Answers without provenance or sources"
        - "Black-box processing where users can't understand why"
      
      example_decision: |
        We require RAG chat to include source citations even when it makes 
        responses longer. Users need to trust and verify AI outputs.
    
    - value: "Incremental Value"
      definition: |
        Every piece of work should deliver measurable value quickly.
        We ship early, learn fast, and iterate based on real usage.
        Waiting for perfect is the enemy of good enough to learn.
      
      behaviors_we_expect:
        - "Features ship incrementally with feedback loops"
        - "MVPs that test core assumptions before full builds"
        - "Telemetry and usage tracking to validate decisions"
      
      behaviors_we_reject:
        - "Multi-month development cycles without user feedback"
        - "Building features based on assumptions alone"
        - "Perfectionism that delays learning"
      
      example_decision: |
        We shipped MCP integration as experimental before full documentation,
        learning from early adopters what actually mattered.
    
    - value: "Developer Experience"
      definition: |
        We build tools we would want to use ourselves. APIs should be elegant,
        documentation should be complete, and errors should be helpful.
        A great DX reduces friction and enables rapid adoption.
      
      behaviors_we_expect:
        - "Comprehensive API documentation with examples"
        - "Meaningful error messages that guide resolution"
        - "OpenAPI specs generated and kept current"
      
      behaviors_we_reject:
        - "Undocumented or inconsistent APIs"
        - "Errors that require source diving to understand"
        - "Breaking changes without migration paths"
      
      example_decision: |
        We maintain generated OpenAPI specs and require scope documentation
        on every protected endpoint, even though it's extra work.
  
  value_conflicts:
    - tension: "Speed vs. Quality (shipping fast vs. comprehensive testing)"
      resolution_principle: |
        Ship fast for feature discovery, quality for infrastructure. 
        New features can be experimental; auth/security cannot.

  # 5. CORE BELIEFS - First Principles That Underpin Our Reasoning
  # ============================================================================
  
  core_beliefs:
    about_emergence:
      - belief: "Intelligence emerges from connections, not just content—the whole is greater than the sum of its parts"
        implication: "We focus on building connected systems (graphs, relationships) not just storing documents"
        evidence: "Emergence in nature: simple rules + building blocks = complex organized behavior (ant colonies, brains, ecosystems)"
      
      - belief: "Simple building blocks + clear rules = exponential combinatorial power"
        implication: "We design atomic primitives (chunks, objects, relationships) that combine through well-defined operations"
        evidence: "DNA's 4 bases create all life; neurons create consciousness; our components should enable unlimited emergent patterns"
      
      - belief: "Design by Emergence: invent the rules, discover the consequences through iteration"
        implication: "Strategy can't be shortcut—we must run experiments and learn. AIM phase validates FIRE phase hypotheses"
        evidence: "Computational irreducibility: complex systems must be run to see outcomes; no algorithm can predict emergent behavior"
      
      - belief: "Self-organizing complexity is the sweet spot between chaos and rigidity"
        implication: "We avoid both over-structured systems (too rigid to adapt) and under-structured systems (too chaotic to be useful)"
        evidence: "Successful complex systems (cities, markets, ecosystems) are organized but not centrally planned"
    
    about_our_market:
      - belief: "LLMs are transforming knowledge work, but need grounding in organizational context to be truly useful"
        implication: "RAG and knowledge graphs become essential infrastructure, not optional"

      - belief: "The value of organizational knowledge compounds when it's connected, not siloed"
        implication: "Graph-based representation is superior to flat document stores"
        evidence: "Knowledge graphs power Google Search, enterprise AI, and semantic web"
    
    about_our_users:
      - belief: "Knowledge workers don't want to manually tag, categorize, or structure information—they want AI to do it"
        implication: "Automatic extraction and graph building is essential, not optional"
        evidence: "Low adoption of manual tagging systems; high interest in AI automation"
      
      - belief: "Users will trust AI answers if they can verify them against sources"
        implication: "Citation and source linking is a core feature, not an afterthought"
        evidence: "Enterprise resistance to AI 'black boxes'; regulatory requirements"
    
    about_our_approach:
      - belief: "Embeddings + knowledge graphs + RAG is the winning stack for organizational knowledge AI"
        implication: "We invest deeply in this stack rather than chasing every AI trend"
        evidence: "This combination addresses retrieval, reasoning, and grounding"
      
      - belief: "API-first enables faster ecosystem growth than UI-first"
        implication: "We prioritize API completeness; UI is one consumer among many"
        evidence: "Successful platforms (Stripe, Twilio) grow through developer adoption"
    
    about_value_creation:
      - belief: "The value is in the connected knowledge, not just the storage"
        implication: "We monetize intelligence and insights, not just ingestion volume"
        evidence: "Commodity storage is cheap; understanding is valuable"
    
    about_competition:
      - belief: "Large platforms (Microsoft, Google) will own general enterprise search, but can't go deep in every domain"
        implication: "We win by depth in specific use cases and developer control, not breadth"
        evidence: "Vertical SaaS succeeds by doing one thing exceptionally well"
    
    belief_challenges:
      - belief: "Automatic extraction quality is good enough for production use"
        counter_evidence: "LLM extraction can be inconsistent; users may need to correct errors"
        monitoring: "Track extraction accuracy rates; user correction frequency"
      
      - belief: "Developer-first will lead to enterprise adoption"
        counter_evidence: "Some enterprises prefer turnkey solutions over APIs"
        monitoring: "Enterprise pipeline feedback; win/loss analysis"
  
  # ============================================================================
  # CONSISTENCY & ALIGNMENT
  # ============================================================================
  
  alignment_checks:
    purpose_vision_alignment: |
      Our purpose (help knowledge workers extract understanding from chaos) directly
      leads to our vision (knowledge infrastructure powering thousands of organizations).
      Success means teams stop drowning in documents and start finding answers instantly.
    
    mission_purpose_alignment: |
      Building AI-powered knowledge platforms (mission) directly addresses the problem
      of scattered, unconnected organizational knowledge (purpose). Every capability—
      ingestion, graph building, search, chat—serves finding and understanding.
    
    values_mission_alignment: |
      "Source of Truth" ensures our AI is useful, not misleading. "Incremental Value"
      keeps us shipping features that matter. "Developer Experience" enables the
      API-first ecosystem growth our mission depends on.
    
    beliefs_inform_strategy: |
      Our belief in embeddings+graphs+RAG drives our technical architecture. Our
      belief in automatic extraction shapes our product priorities. Our belief
      in API-first guides our go-to-market approach.

product_portfolio:
  description: |
    Emergent is a layered ecosystem where each product enables the next level of emergence.
    Building blocks form higher-level building blocks: documents become knowledge (Core),
    knowledge informs strategy (Frameworks), strategy enables execution (Tools).
    
    Like emergence in nature, the value of the ecosystem is exponentially greater than
    the sum of its parts. Each product line serves a distinct purpose while sharing common
    values, technology foundations, and the philosophy of Design by Emergence.

      tagline: "Headless orchestration for methodology execution"
      status: "in-development"
      description: |
        A programmatic execution engine for EPF workflows, enabling AI agents to
        autonomously execute structured product development cycles. Runtime shares
        authentication, authorization, multi-tenancy, and RLS infrastructure with
        Core for native integration. Designed to evolve into the OS layer for the
        Emergent ecosystem where Core and other applications run as native apps.

      strategic_vision: |
        Long-term evolution path: Runtime becomes the platform layer ("OS") for
        Emergent ecosystem. Core transitions from standalone app to first-class
        application running on Runtime platform. Enables third-party apps to
        leverage same infrastructure (auth, multi-tenancy, workflows, knowledge graphs).
