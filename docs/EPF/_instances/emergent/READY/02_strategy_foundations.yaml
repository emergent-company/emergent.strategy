  # 1. PRODUCT VISION
  # ============================================================================

  product_vision:
    vision_statement: |
      By 2028, Emergent will be the invisible intelligence layer powering thousands 
      of organizations. AI assistants will reason over connected organizational knowledge—
      not just search it. Strategy will flow seamlessly into execution, with every 
      decision traceable to intent and every outcome feeding back to evolve strategy.
      Organizations will experience "Design by Emergence": invent the rules, discover 
      the consequences.

    target_timeframe: '3-5 years (2028)'

    success_indicators:
      - indicator: 'Organizations using Emergent Core'
        target: '5,000+ organizations'

      addresses_opportunity:
        opportunity_aspect: "AI agents are smart but blind—they don't know what teams are building or why"
        user_benefit: 'Teams get AI that understands their product intent, architecture decisions, and business goals'
      differentiator: 'We build the context layer connecting strategy → knowledge → code, not just another AI search tool'

      "Beachhead then expand": Start with technical product teams who feel the pain acutely,
      can adopt developer-friendly tools, and provide fast feedback loops. Build depth in 
      this segment before expanding horizontally.

          Enterprise is the long-term prize but requires maturity built in phases 1-2.
          By phase 3 we have proven product, reference customers, and enterprise features.

    sequencing_constraints:
      dependencies:

          dependency: 'Proven ROI metrics and case studies needed'
      risks_of_sequence:
        - risk: 'Big tech bundling could accelerate before we reach scale'
          mitigation: "Focus on depth and developer control that bundled solutions can't match"
        - risk: 'Well-funded competitors could move downmarket'
          mitigation: 'Stay focused on API-first segment where enterprise DNA is disadvantage'
        - risk: 'Technical teams may expect free/open-source core'
          mitigation: 'Offer generous free tier with premium features for paid'
      alternative_considered: 'Enterprise-first approach rejected because we lack enterprise sales DNA and the sales cycle would starve us of product feedback'

      Workspace-centric with progressive depth: Users start with a unified workspace
      containing all their knowledge, then drill into documents, entities, and 
      relationships. AI chat and search are ever-present overlays, not buried features.
