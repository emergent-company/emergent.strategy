# STRATEGY Phase: Foundational Strategic Artifacts for Emergent
# This is a living document containing four core strategic definitions that inform the winning formula.
# These artifacts must be consistent with:
# - Organizational North Star (00_north_star.yaml)
# - INSIGHT analyses (01_insight_analyses.yaml)
# - Opportunity statement (03_insight_opportunity.yaml)
#
# CHANGE PROTOCOL: If any of these foundations change, you MUST update 04_strategy_formula.yaml to maintain consistency

  product_vision:
    vision_statement: |
      By 2028, Emergent will be the invisible intelligence layer powering thousands 
      of organizations. AI assistants will reason over connected organizational knowledge—
      not just search it. Strategy will flow seamlessly into execution, with every 
      decision traceable to intent and every outcome feeding back to evolve strategy.
      Organizations will experience "Design by Emergence": invent the rules, discover 
      the consequences.
    
    target_timeframe: "3-5 years (2028)"
    
    success_indicators:

  # ============================================================================
  # The deliberate order of value delivery and market expansion
  
  strategic_sequencing:
    sequencing_principle: |
      "Beachhead then expand": Start with technical product teams who feel the pain acutely,
      can adopt developer-friendly tools, and provide fast feedback loops. Build depth in 
      this segment before expanding horizontally. Let the product prove itself through 
      dogfooding and early adopter success before enterprise sales motions.
    
    phases:
      - phase: 1
        name: "Beachhead: Technical Product Teams"
        timeframe: "2025 H1-H2"
        focus: "Prove core value with teams like ourselves—technical, documentation-heavy, AI-forward"
        
        target_segment: "Technical product teams (5-50 engineers) at software companies and consultancies"
        target_problem: "AI coding assistants lack context about product intent, architecture decisions, and business goals"
        
        value_delivered:
          - "Document ingestion from URLs, file uploads, integrations"
          - "Semantic search with source citations"
          - "AI chat grounded in organizational knowledge"
          - "MCP server for AI agent integration"
          - "EPF for git-native strategy management"
        
        success_criteria:
          - "100 teams actively using Emergent for daily development"
          - "50%+ improvement in AI task completion with Emergent context vs. without"
          - "NPS > 50 for 'understanding product context'"
          - "< 24 hours from strategy update to team alignment"
        
        strategic_rationale: |
          Technical teams are our tribe—we understand their problems because we are them.
          They can adopt self-serve, provide technical feedback, and validate the developer
          experience. Consulting relationships (TwentyFirst, Eyedea) provide warm leads.
          Dogfooding Emergent on Emergent creates tight feedback loops and credibility.
      
      - phase: 2
        name: "Expand: Professional Services & Consulting"
        timeframe: "2026 H1-H2"
        focus: "Extend to high-information-density organizations with similar pain points"
        
        enabled_by_phase_1: "Proven extraction quality, stable APIs, case studies from tech teams"
        
        target_segment: "Consultancies, agencies, professional services firms (10-200 people)"
        new_value_delivered:
          - "Project-based knowledge organization and reuse"
          - "Client-specific knowledge graphs with access controls"
          - "EPF-Runtime MVP for programmatic workflow orchestration (Q1-Q2 2026)"
          - "Integration with common consulting tools (SharePoint, Box, etc.)"
        
        success_criteria:
          - "500+ organizations using Emergent"
          - "Expansion revenue from existing accounts"
          - "Enterprise integration catalog (5+ major platforms)"
        
        strategic_rationale: |
          Professional services share the pain of knowledge-intensive work and reuse.
          Higher willingness to pay (billable hour optimization). Existing consulting 
          relationships provide warm introductions. Similar adoption pattern (team-led, 
          not enterprise-sales-first).
          
          EPF-Runtime launches in Phase 2 because: (1) Core infrastructure proven and stable,
          (2) Consulting teams need structured methodologies for complex client work,
          (3) AI agents require orchestration for multi-step strategic processes,
          (4) Native integration with Core (shared auth, RLS, multi-tenancy) de-risks deployment,
          (5) Validates methodology automation value before enterprise-wide adoption.
      
      - phase: 3
        name: "Scale: Enterprise Knowledge Infrastructure"
        timeframe: "2027+"
        focus: "Become the standard knowledge layer for enterprise AI"
        
        enabled_by_phase_2: "Enterprise-ready security, governance, integrations; proven ROI"
        
        target_segment: "Enterprise teams (IT, engineering, research) at larger organizations"
        new_value_delivered:
          - "Enterprise SSO, audit logging, compliance features"
          - "Deep integrations with enterprise platforms (M365, Google Workspace, Salesforce)"
          - "Department-level and organization-wide knowledge graphs"
        
        success_criteria:
          - "5,000+ organizations using Emergent"
          - "Enterprise contracts with defined SLAs"
          - "Recognition as category leader in AI knowledge infrastructure"
        
        strategic_rationale: |
          Enterprise is the long-term prize but requires maturity we build in phases 1-2.
          By phase 3, we have: proven product, reference customers, enterprise features,
          and the ability to compete on depth rather than sales muscle.
    
    sequencing_constraints:
      dependencies:
        - "Phase 2 requires SOC 2 compliance and enterprise security features"
        - "Phase 3 requires proven ROI metrics from phases 1-2"
        - "All phases require maintaining extraction/search quality as data scale increases"
      
      risks_of_sequence:
        - "Big tech bundling could accelerate before we reach scale"
        - "Well-funded competitors (Glean) could move downmarket"
        - "Technical teams may expect free/open-source core"
      
      alternative_considered: |
        Enterprise-first approach: Rejected because we lack enterprise sales DNA,
        and the sales cycle would starve us of product feedback. Developer-led 
        adoption with bottom-up growth fits our strengths.
    
    consistency_check:
      aligns_with_trends: "Developer-led AI adoption, MCP agent architectures, enterprise AI spending"
      de_risks_assumptions: "Phase 1 tests core extraction and search quality with friendly users first"
