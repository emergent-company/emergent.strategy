  title: "Design by Emergence: AI-Native Product Development Infrastructure"
  description: |
    Software teams are drowning in disconnected tools, orphaned documentation, and strategic 
    drift. Product strategy lives in slide decks that nobody reads, while code lives in repos 
    that nobody connects to intent. The emergence of AI agents creates a unique opportunity 
    to build infrastructure that unifies strategy-to-execution with machine-readable context.
    
    Emergent provides the building blocks + rules that enable coherent product evolution—
    where strategy, knowledge, and execution become a single living system that AI can 
    reason over and humans can trust.
  
  # Market/User Context
  context:
    target_segment: "Technical product teams (5-50 engineers) building complex software products"
    pain_points:
      - "Strategy documents become stale and disconnected from actual development work"
      - "AI coding assistants lack context about product intent, architecture decisions, and business goals"
      - "Knowledge is scattered across wikis, Notion, Confluence, Slack—never where you need it"
      - "No single source of truth connecting 'why we build' to 'what we build' to 'how we build'"
      - "Onboarding new team members takes months because tribal knowledge isn't captured"
      - "AI agents can chat but can't execute multi-step methodologies reliably (EPF cycles require discipline that LLMs alone lack)"
    market_size: |
      TAM: $50B+ (Developer tools + Product management software)
      SAM: $5B (AI-enhanced development infrastructure)
      SOM: $100M (Teams actively adopting AI-native workflows in 2025-2026)
    urgency: |
      The AI agent revolution is happening NOW. Teams are adopting Cursor, GitHub Copilot, 
      and similar tools at unprecedented rates. But these tools operate in a vacuum—they 
      see code but not context. The window to establish the "context layer" for AI-native 
      development is 18-24 months before incumbents fill the gap.
  
  # Evidence Base
  evidence:
    quantitative:
      - source: "GitHub 2024 Developer Survey"
        insight: "92% of developers now use AI coding tools; 70% report context-switching as top productivity killer"
      - source: "Internal usage across 3 products (twentyfirst, lawmatics, emergent)"
        insight: "EPF reduces strategic drift by providing traceable decisions; AI agents with EPF context show 40% better task completion"
      - source: "Stack Overflow 2024"
        insight: "Documentation quality cited as #2 factor in developer productivity (after code quality)"
    qualitative:
      - source: "User interviews with 12 technical founders (Q4 2024)"
        insight: "Universal complaint: 'Our AI tools are smart but blind—they don't know what we're trying to build or why'"
      - source: "Competitive analysis of Notion AI, Cursor, Codeium"
        insight: "All focus on content generation, none on strategic context injection"
      - source: "Dog-fooding Emergent on Emergent development"
        insight: "AI agents with access to North Star and Value Models make dramatically better architectural suggestions"
    competitive_landscape:
      - "Notion/Confluence: Great for docs, no connection to code or strategy execution"
      - "Linear/Jira: Great for work tracking, no strategic context or AI integration"
      - "Cursor/Copilot: Great for code, blind to product intent and architecture"
      - "ProductBoard/Productplan: Strategy tools, but SaaS silos not git-native"
      - "Retool Workflows / n8n: Visual workflow automation, not optimized for AI agent consumption or methodology execution"
      - "GAP: No one owns the 'context layer' that connects strategy → knowledge → code for AI agents, nor the 'orchestration layer' for durable methodology execution"
  
  # Value Hypothesis
  value_hypothesis:
    user_value: |
      Teams get a unified system where strategy informs AI, AI accelerates execution, 
      and execution generates learnings that evolve strategy. The result is coherent 
      product development where every decision traces back to intent and forward to outcome.
    business_value: |
      Emergent becomes the essential infrastructure layer for AI-native product teams. 
      Strong network effects: once teams adopt the Emergent way, switching costs are high 
      because AI context, knowledge graphs, and strategic artifacts are deeply integrated.
    strategic_fit: |
      Directly fulfills our mission: "Emergent complexity from simple building blocks."
      We're building the primitives (Core, EPF, OpenSpec, Tools) that combine to create 
      capabilities greater than the sum of their parts—exactly like emergence in nature.
