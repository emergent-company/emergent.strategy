definition:
  purpose: |
    Diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplaces perform better and are 
    better places to work. Without intentional effort, organizations 
    default to homogeneity and bias. A DEI program creates intentional 
    practices for building an inclusive culture.
    
  outcome: |
    Hiring is inclusive and reduces bias. Employees feel they belong. 
    Opportunities are equitable. The organization reflects diverse 
    perspectives and backgrounds.

# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-036-001
    name: "Starting DEI Work at a Homogeneous Startup"
    practitioner: Head of People at 30-person startup
    organization_context: |
      B2B SaaS company, 30 employees, mostly white/Asian men. Founders 
      recognize lack of diversity but don't know where to start. Hiring 
      has been mostly through networks, which perpetuates homogeneity. 
      No one has complained, but leadership knows it's a problem.
    situation: |
      New Head of People joins and notices: 28 of 30 employees are male, 
      leadership team is all white men, engineers are from 5 universities. 
      Not intentional, but pipeline and networks haven't created diversity. 
      Founders say: "We hire the best people regardless of background." 
      Head of People needs to introduce DEI without creating defensiveness.
    trigger: |
      Candidate declines offer citing "lack of diversity" as concern. 
      CEO is surprised: "I didn't realize it looked that way from outside." 
      Asks Head of People to develop DEI approach.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Started with data—documented current demographics (with legal considerations)"
      - "Week 1: Analyzed hiring funnel: where does diversity drop off?"
      - "Week 2: Presented to leadership: 'We have opportunity to build more diverse team. Here's current state.'"
      - "Week 2: Framed as business case (better decisions, broader perspectives) not just moral case"
      - "Week 3: Identified 3 starting points: job descriptions, sourcing channels, interview structure"
      - "Week 3: Rewrote job descriptions using bias checkers (Textio, Gender Decoder)"
      - "Month 1: Expanded sourcing to include HBCUs, diversity-focused job boards, employee networks beyond the usual"
      - "Month 1: Implemented structured interviews with scorecards (reduces bias)"
      - "Month 2: First diverse hire made—celebrated as signal of intentional change"
      - "Month 3: Shared progress transparently: 'We're working on this. Here's what we've changed.'"
    outcome: |
      Over 6 months, new hires were 45% women and 35% underrepresented 
      minorities (vs. 7% and 10% before). No sacrifice in quality—if 
      anything, candidates were stronger. Existing team responded well 
      to transparent communication about intent. The candidate who 
      declined? Referred someone else once they saw the company was 
      serious about change.
    lessons:
      - "Start with data, not assumptions—understand where diversity drops off in your pipeline"
      - "Frame as business opportunity, not guilt—defensiveness kills progress"
      - "Small changes compound: job descriptions, sourcing, interview structure"
      - "Transparency about intent builds credibility even before results arrive"
      - "First diverse hires are ambassadors—their experience matters enormously"

  - id: ps-036-002
    name: "Responding to Employee Concerns About Inclusion"
    practitioner: CEO at 60-person company
    organization_context: |
      Company has improved diversity in hiring. Team is now 40% women, 
      25% underrepresented minorities. But some employees are voicing 
      concerns about inclusion—feeling like they need to assimilate, 
      microaggressions in meetings, lack of representation in leadership.
    situation: |
      Three employees separately raise concerns to HR about feeling 
      marginalized. They're not accusing anyone specific, but describing 
      a pattern: being interrupted in meetings, ideas attributed to others, 
      feeling like outsiders in social activities. CEO realizes diversity 
      was step one; inclusion is step two.
    trigger: |
      Anonymous pulse survey comment: "It's hard to be yourself here when 
      you're different from most people." CEO asks to meet with employees 
      who raised concerns (with their permission) to understand better.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: CEO met 1:1 with 5 employees from underrepresented groups (all volunteers)"
      - "Week 1: Asked: 'What's it like to work here? What would make it better?' Listened without defending."
      - "Week 2: Compiled themes: interruption in meetings, social dynamics, lack of visible role models"
      - "Week 2: Presented to leadership team: 'We've made diversity progress, but inclusion is lagging. Here's what I heard.'"
      - "Week 3: Committed to 3 actions: meeting facilitation training, ERG launch, mentorship program"
      - "Week 3: All managers attended meeting facilitation training (interrupt interruptions, round-robin, track airtime)"
      - "Month 2: Launched first ERG (Women) with budget and executive sponsor"
      - "Month 2: Paired 10 employees from underrepresented groups with mentors in leadership"
      - "Month 3: CEO publicly acknowledged this work in all-hands: 'We're learning. Thank you for pushing us.'"
      - "Month 6: Follow-up pulse showed improvement on belonging scores (6.1 → 7.4)"
    outcome: |
      Employees felt heard—several expressed appreciation for CEO 
      willingness to listen and act. ERG became community and feedback 
      channel. Meeting dynamics improved measurably (tracked interruptions 
      in leadership meetings, reduced by 60%). Two employees who had 
      raised concerns became ERG leaders. Retention of underrepresented 
      groups improved from 70% to 88% over 12 months.
    lessons:
      - "Diversity without inclusion creates frustration—hired but not welcomed"
      - "Direct conversation with affected employees reveals what surveys miss"
      - "CEO involvement signals seriousness—can't delegate DEI entirely"
      - "Concrete actions (training, ERGs, mentorship) matter more than statements"
      - "Progress is visible in retention, not just hiring numbers"

  - id: ps-036-003
    name: "Pay Equity Audit Reveals Disparities"
    practitioner: VP People at 90-person company
    organization_context: |
      Company has grown rapidly with ad hoc compensation decisions. 
      Some employees negotiated aggressively, others didn't. No systematic 
      pay philosophy until recently. Board is asking about pay equity. 
      VP People suspects there might be issues but hasn't had data.
    situation: |
      VP People conducts first pay equity analysis as part of compensation 
      review. Results are uncomfortable: women are paid 8% less than men 
      in equivalent roles, even controlling for experience and performance. 
      The gap isn't intentional—it's accumulated through negotiations and 
      counter-offers. But it's real and needs to be fixed.
    trigger: |
      Board asks: "Do we have pay equity issues?" VP People completes 
      analysis and brings results to CEO: "Yes. We have a gender pay gap. 
      Here's what it looks like, here's what it costs to fix, here's my 
      recommendation."
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Completed detailed analysis: pay by role, level, gender, tenure, performance"
      - "Week 1: Identified 12 employees clearly underpaid relative to peers (8 were women)"
      - "Week 2: Presented to CEO with options: immediate correction, phased correction, or band adjustment"
      - "Week 2: CEO chose immediate correction: 'We fix this now. What's the cost?'"
      - "Week 2: Cost: $180K in annual salary adjustments (1.5% of payroll)"
      - "Week 3: CEO and VP People met with each affected employee individually"
      - "Week 3: Framed as: 'We identified a pay equity issue and we're fixing it. Your compensation is being adjusted.'"
      - "Week 3: Implemented salary increases effective immediately"
      - "Month 1: Communicated philosophy change to all employees: 'We now review pay equity annually'"
      - "Month 1: Implemented structured compensation bands to prevent future drift"
      - "Annually: Pay equity audit now part of annual compensation review"
    outcome: |
      Pay gap closed from 8% to 1% (within statistical noise). Employees 
      who received adjustments were deeply appreciative—several mentioned 
      it in Glassdoor reviews. No legal issues because company proactively 
      corrected. Board satisfied with response. Company now markets pay 
      equity commitment in recruiting. Annual audit prevents recurrence.
    lessons:
      - "Pay equity issues accumulate without intention—negotiations and counter-offers create gaps"
      - "Analysis is the first step—you can't fix what you don't measure"
      - "Immediate correction is better than phased—demonstrates seriousness"
      - "Individual communication matters—employees feel seen, not processed"
      - "Ongoing audits prevent recurrence—this is annual hygiene, not one-time fix"

# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Corporate DEI has evolved significantly over the past decade. The 
    2020 racial justice movement accelerated investment in DEI programs, 
    though sustainability has varied. Best-in-class organizations treat 
    DEI as business strategy, not compliance.
    
    Evidence consistently shows diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones 
    on complex problems. McKinsey research demonstrates correlation between 
    executive diversity and financial performance. Yet most organizations 
    struggle to move beyond incremental progress.
    
    The distinction between diversity (representation) and inclusion 
    (belonging) is increasingly understood. Hiring diverse candidates 
    without inclusive culture leads to turnover and frustration. Modern 
    DEI programs address both.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Start with data"
      description: "Understand current state before setting goals"
      evidence: "Organizations that baseline demographics see 2x improvement rates"
    
    - practice: "Change systems, not just outcomes"
      description: "Focus on process changes (sourcing, interviews, promotions) that drive representation"
      evidence: "Quota-focused programs often backfire; process-focused programs sustain"
    
    - practice: "CEO ownership"
      description: "DEI as business priority, not HR initiative"
      evidence: "CEO-sponsored DEI programs are 3x more likely to achieve goals"
    
    - practice: "Inclusion alongside diversity"
      description: "Invest in belonging, not just representation"
      evidence: "Diverse employees in inclusive cultures have 3x lower turnover"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Diversity without inclusion"
      description: "Hiring diverse candidates into non-inclusive environment"
      consequence: "High turnover, poor reputation, wasted recruiting investment"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Statement without action"
      description: "Publishing DEI statement without changing practices"
      consequence: "Cynicism from employees and candidates, performative DEI"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Pipeline excuse"
      description: "'We'd love to hire more diverse candidates but the pipeline is thin'"
      consequence: "Accepting status quo, not investing in sourcing or development"
    
    - anti_pattern: "One-size-fits-all"
      description: "Treating all underrepresented groups the same"
      consequence: "Ignores different experiences and needs of different groups"

  benchmarks:
    - metric: "Representation vs. industry"
