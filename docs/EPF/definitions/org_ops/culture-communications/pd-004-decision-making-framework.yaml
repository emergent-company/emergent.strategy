definition:
  purpose: |
    Unclear decision-making authority leads to delays, frustration, and either 
    bottlenecks (everything escalates) or chaos (conflicting decisions). This 
    framework clarifies who can make what decisions, how to escalate, and how 
    to make decisions efficiently.
    
  outcome: |
    Team knows who makes different types of decisions. Escalation path is clear. 
    Decisions are made at the appropriate level without unnecessary delays or 
    overreach.

  success_criteria:
    - Written decision rights matrix exists
    - All team members know their decision authority
    - Escalation path is clear and used appropriately
    - Decision delays reduced
    - Fewer "who decides this?" conversations

operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - Leadership willing to delegate
    - Trust in team judgment
    - Budget/spending limits defined
    
  common_blockers:
    - "Over-centralization → Start with low-risk delegation"
    - "Fear of mistakes → Emphasize reversible decisions"
    - "Unclear boundaries → Be specific with thresholds"
