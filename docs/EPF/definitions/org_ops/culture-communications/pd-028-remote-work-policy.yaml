definition:
  purpose: |
    With remote and hybrid work common, clarity on expectations is essential. 
    Without a policy, confusion arises about where and when to work. A good 
    remote policy balances flexibility with collaboration and accountability.
    
  outcome: |
    Everyone knows work location expectations. Remote workers have what 
    they need to be effective. Communication norms bridge location gaps. 
    The team can collaborate effectively regardless of location.

# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-028-001
    name: "Transitioning from Office-First to Hybrid"
    practitioner: Head of People at 55-person company
    organization_context: |
      Company was fully in-office until pandemic forced remote. During 
      remote period, they hired 15 people across different cities. Now 
      leadership wants to "return to office" but realize it's not that 
      simple—not everyone can return, and many don't want to.
    situation: |
      CEO announces "back to office" expectation. Immediately, three 
      engineers (all hired remotely, in different states) ask: "Does 
      this mean I'm being let go?" Several office-based employees also 
      push back: "I've proven I can work remotely. Why do I have to 
      commute?" Leadership debates but has no clear policy.
    trigger: |
      Senior engineer (remote-hired, high performer) gets competing 
      offer from fully remote company. They'll stay if they can remain 
      remote, but need clarity. CEO says: "We need a policy. Fast."
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Head of People surveyed all employees: 'What work arrangement would you prefer?'"
      - "Week 1: Results: 20% want fully remote, 40% prefer hybrid (2-3 days), 25% prefer mostly in-office, 15% flexible"
      - "Week 1: Also mapped which roles genuinely require in-person presence"
      - "Week 2: Proposed 'Hybrid-flexible' model: most roles can be 2-3 days remote, some roles fully remote eligible"
      - "Week 2: Defined 'anchor days' (Tue/Wed) where in-person collaboration encouraged"
      - "Week 2: Created clear policy document with expectations, equipment stipend, communication norms"
      - "Week 3: Rolled out with FAQ and manager training"
      - "Week 3: Established 90-day trial period with feedback checkpoints"
      - "Week 4: Senior engineer stayed—clarity was what they needed"
      - "Month 3: Refined policy based on trial feedback, formalized exceptions process"
    outcome: |
      Retained key remote employees. Created clear, documented policy 
      that reduced anxiety. Anchor days created regular collaboration 
      rhythm. Some roles went fully remote (recruiting, some engineers); 
      most settled into 2-3 day hybrid. Clarity eliminated daily 
      "should I come in?" friction.
    lessons:
      - "Survey employees before making policy—understand actual preferences"
      - "Map role requirements—not all roles have same needs"
      - "Clarity matters as much as flexibility—uncertainty causes anxiety"
      - "Trial periods allow iteration—don't try to get it perfect on day one"
      - "Write it down—verbal policy creates confusion"

  - id: ps-028-002
    name: "Managing Performance Concerns in Remote Setting"
    practitioner: Engineering Manager at 35-person company
    organization_context: |
      Fully remote company since founding. Works well for most team 
      members. One engineer (18 months tenure, previously strong 
      performer) has become unresponsive. Misses standup, slow to 
      respond, quality declining. Manager suspects personal issues 
      but doesn't want to pry.
    situation: |
      Engineer's work output has dropped significantly. They miss 
      standups, don't respond to Slack for hours, and recent PRs have 
      unusual bugs. Teammates are picking up slack and getting 
      frustrated. Manager has no visibility into what's happening—
      can't just walk by their desk.
    trigger: |
      Engineer misses a critical deadline, and teammate escalates: 
      "I can't cover for them anymore. This isn't fair to the rest 
      of us." Manager realizes they've been avoiding the conversation.
    actions:
      - "Day 1: Manager scheduled 1:1 with engineer—framed as check-in, not confrontation"
      - "Day 1: Asked open-ended questions: 'How are things going? Anything affecting your work?'"
      - "Day 1: Engineer disclosed: dealing with family health crisis, struggling to focus"
      - "Day 1: Manager expressed empathy, asked: 'What would help right now?'"
      - "Day 2: Jointly created temporary plan: reduced scope, more async, weekly check-ins"
      - "Day 2: Manager communicated to team: '[Engineer] has temporary personal situation, we're adjusting workload'"
      - "Week 2: Engineer stabilized, started meeting commitments again"
      - "Week 4: Family situation improved, engineer gradually returned to full capacity"
      - "Month 2: Manager established regular 'life check-ins' for all reports—normalized in remote setting"
      - "Month 3: Documented process for handling similar situations in manager guide"
    outcome: |
      Retained valuable employee through difficult period. Built 
      trust—engineer more willing to communicate proactively. Team 
      understood temporary adjustment without full details. Manager 
      learned that remote work requires more deliberate check-ins—
      can't rely on casual observation.
    lessons:
      - "Remote work hides personal struggles—deliberate check-ins essential"
      - "Performance issues often have non-work causes—ask before assuming"
      - "Temporary accommodations can prevent permanent departures"
      - "Transparency with team (without details) maintains trust"
      - "Formalize 'how are you really doing?' into remote management practice"

  - id: ps-028-003
    name: "Building Culture Across Time Zones"
    practitioner: CEO at 25-person fully distributed company
    organization_context: |
      Company is fully remote with employees across US, Europe, and 
      Asia. Founded remote-first, never had office. Early culture was 
      strong—everyone joined calls, lots of Slack banter. As team 
      grew from 10 to 25, culture feels fragmented. APAC team feels 
      like second-class citizens. US team dominates discussions.
    situation: |
      Company-wide meeting scheduled at 9am Pacific—works for US 
      and Europe, midnight for Singapore employees. APAC team stopped 
      attending. When CEO asked, they said: "Meetings are always at 
      inconvenient times. We watch recordings, but we're never in 
      the conversation." CEO realized they've been optimizing for 
      majority, not inclusion.
    trigger: |
      Two APAC employees (both strong performers) resign same week. 
      Exit interviews reveal: "Felt disconnected. Never felt like 
      real part of the team." CEO realizes timezone exclusion is 
      causing attrition.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: CEO met with all APAC team members—listened to experience, collected suggestions"
      - "Week 1: Mapped all recurring meetings—found 80% were US-timezone-optimized"
      - "Week 2: Restructured meeting approach: company-wide meetings rotate times (alternating friendly to different zones)"
      - "Week 2: Established 'overlap hours' (2-hour window where all timezones are awake)"
      - "Week 2: Moved most meetings async: recorded updates, written proposals, async decisions"
      - "Week 3: Created timezone-distributed social events (virtual coffee with matched pairs across zones)"
      - "Week 3: Assigned APAC lead to represent timezone in planning discussions"
      - "Month 1: Started quarterly in-person gatherings (rotate locations: US, Europe, Asia)"
      - "Month 2: APAC engagement scores improved significantly"
      - "Month 6: Promoted APAC employee to leadership—visible commitment to distributed inclusion"
    outcome: |
      Attrition stopped. APAC team engagement improved. Meeting 
      culture shifted to async-first with synchronous for high-value 
      collaboration. Quarterly gatherings created real relationships 
      across timezones. Company developed true distributed-first 
      culture, not "remote with US headquarters."
    lessons:
      - "Timezone distribution requires deliberate meeting design—don't default to 'majority wins'"
      - "Async-first is essential for global teams—synchronous is exception, not default"
      - "Representation matters—ensure all timezones have voice in decisions"
      - "In-person gatherings (periodic) are essential for distributed teams—not optional"
      - "Culture doesn't just happen remotely—requires intentional design"

# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Remote work accelerated dramatically since 2020. What was once 
    rare became universal, then settled into varied models: fully 
    remote, hybrid, flexible, and office-first with remote option.
    
    Research shows remote work can maintain or improve productivity 
    for most knowledge work, but requires different management 
    approaches. The challenge is not productivity but culture, 
    connection, and collaboration.
    
    Companies are still experimenting. High-profile return-to-office 
    mandates coexist with successful fully-distributed companies. 
    No single model works for all organizations—fit depends on work 
    type, culture, and employee preferences.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Async-first communication"
      description: "Default to written, recorded, searchable—synchronous for high-value collaboration"
      evidence: "Reduces meeting fatigue, enables timezone equity, creates documentation naturally"
    
    - practice: "Written documentation of decisions"
      description: "All significant decisions documented—not just for remote, but essential for it"
      evidence: "Prevents 'you had to be there' information asymmetry"
    
    - practice: "Deliberate social connection"
      description: "Budget time and money for virtual and in-person social activities"
      evidence: "Relationships don't form passively in remote—require intentional investment"
    
    - practice: "Outcome-based management"
      description: "Measure results, not activity or presence"
      evidence: "Activity monitoring destroys trust; outcome focus enables autonomy"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Hybrid as worst of both"
      description: "Half-measure hybrid that doesn't work well for remote or in-office"
      consequence: "Remote employees disadvantaged, in-office questioned why they commute"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Surveillance management"
      description: "Activity monitoring, always-on video, checking online status"
      consequence: "Destroys trust, drives away top performers, creates performative work"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Meeting culture transferred online"
      description: "Same number of meetings, just on Zoom"
      consequence: "Zoom fatigue, no time for deep work, worse than in-office"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Policy ambiguity"
      description: "Unclear or inconsistent expectations about remote work"
      consequence: "Anxiety, unfairness, constant negotiation"

  benchmarks:
