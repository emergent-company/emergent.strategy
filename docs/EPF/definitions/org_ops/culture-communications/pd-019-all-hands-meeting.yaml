definition:
  purpose: |
    In growing organizations, information silos form. People don't know 
    what other teams are doing. Strategy feels distant. All-hands meetings 
    create shared context, celebrate wins, and give everyone access to 
    leadership.
    
  outcome: |
    All employees hear consistent company updates directly from leadership. 
    There's opportunity to ask questions and get answers. Team 
    accomplishments are visible. Company direction is reinforced.
