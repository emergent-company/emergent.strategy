definition:
  purpose: |
    Change is constant in startups, but poorly managed change creates 
    confusion, resistance, and failure. Even good changes fail without 
    proper communication and support. A change management process 
    increases the likelihood that changes stick.
    
  outcome: |
    Changes are communicated clearly. People understand why changes 
    happen. Transition support is provided. Resistance is addressed. 
    Changes are adopted successfully.
