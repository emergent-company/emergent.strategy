definition:
  purpose: |
    Quarterly reporting is your regular rhythm of accountability and 
    communication with investors. Good quarterly reports build investor 
    confidence, maintain trust, and often lead to valuable support when 
    you need it most.
    
    This is not just about compliance or keeping investors informed. 
    Strong quarterly reporting creates a forcing function for leadership 
    to reflect on progress, identify problems early, and maintain strategic 
    clarity. The discipline of preparing a board report often reveals 
    issues before they become critical.
    
    The opposite approach - sparse or reactive communication - erodes trust 
    over time. When founders only reach out with bad news or funding 
    requests, investors become skeptical. Regular, honest updates create 
    the relationship capital that matters during difficult periods.
    
    Warning signs of inadequate quarterly reporting:
    - Investors asking basic questions about the business
    - Board meetings dominated by information sharing vs. discussion
    - Surprised reactions to bad news
    - Requests for better data going unmet
    - Strained investor relationships
    
  outcome: |
    A consistent quarterly reporting practice that keeps investors informed, 
    maintains trust and confidence, surfaces issues early, and positions 
    the company well for future fundraising.

practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "First-Time CEO Preparing First Board Deck"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      First-time founder, just raised seed round 6 months ago. First 
      formal board meeting coming up. Never prepared a board deck before. 
      Board is 3 people: CEO, investor, independent.
    situation: |
      Raised $2M seed 6 months ago. First board meeting in 2 weeks. 
      Investor asked for board materials but founder has never created 
      a board deck. Nervous about what to include and how to present.
    trigger: |
      Lead investor emailed asking for board materials 5 days before 
      meeting. Founder realizes needs to prepare something professional.
    actions: |
      1. Asked investor for example board decks from portfolio. Received 
         two anonymized examples to use as templates.
      2. Gathered data: pulled financials from QuickBooks, metrics from 
         dashboard, compiled hiring status from HR spreadsheet.
      3. Created outline: Executive summary, Financials, Metrics, 
         Milestones, Team, Risks, Next quarter.
      4. Built 18-slide deck:
         - Slide 1: Executive summary (3 bullets: traction, challenges, focus)
         - Slides 2-4: Financial overview (P&L, burn, runway)
         - Slides 5-7: Key metrics (customers, revenue, engagement)
         - Slides 8-10: Milestone progress (what we said vs. what we did)
         - Slide 11: Team update (hired 3, looking for 2)
         - Slide 12-13: Risks and challenges (honest assessment)
         - Slides 14-15: Strategic discussion topics (2 questions for board)
         - Slides 16-18: Next quarter goals and focus
      5. Sent to investor 4 days before meeting for feedback. Got 
         suggestions to add more context on one metric.
      6. Revised and sent final version 3 days before meeting.
    outcome: |
      Board meeting went smoothly. Board members appreciated transparency 
      and structure. Discussion was productive, focused on strategic 
      questions rather than information gathering. Investor said it was 
      among best first board decks received. Established template for 
      future quarters.
    lessons:
      - Ask for examples - investors are happy to share templates
      - Structure enables productive discussion
      - Transparency builds trust faster than perfection
      - Getting feedback before meeting catches issues

  - id: ps-002
    name: "CFO Managing Quarterly Reporting During Down Round"
    practitioner: "CFO"
    organization_context: |
      60-person Series B company. Growth has slowed. Current round will 
      be down or flat. Need to maintain board and investor confidence 
      through difficult period.
    situation: |
      Revenue growth slowed from 3x to 1.5x. Burn is higher than planned. 
      Need to raise in 6 months but metrics are not strong. Quarterly 
      report must be honest but constructive.
    trigger: |
      CEO asked CFO to lead quarterly reporting given sensitivity. Need 
      to present realistic picture while maintaining investor confidence.
    actions: |
      1. Started with honest assessment: revenue growth at 1.5x vs. 3x 
         target, burn $200K/month over plan, runway 10 months.
      2. Analyzed root causes: slowing growth tied to market shift (not 
         just execution), identified leading indicators of improvement.
      3. Created comparison: showed what similar companies experienced, 
         demonstrated the team recognized issues early.
      4. Built forward plan: showed specific actions to improve 
         trajectory (cost cuts, focus on best customers, product pivot).
      5. Financial presentation emphasized: honest current state, 
         clear understanding of drivers, credible improvement plan.
      6. Prepared for tough questions: anticipated board pushback, 
         prepared data to support answers.
      7. CEO and CFO rehearsed presentation together. Aligned on tone: 
         serious but confident, honest but not defeated.
      8. Included specific asks: board introductions for strategic 
         partnership, advice on fundraising timing.
    outcome: |
      Difficult board meeting, but board appreciated honesty and 
      clear-eyed assessment. Approved revised plan. Board members 
      provided intros and advice. Trust maintained through 
      transparency. Company raised flat round 8 months later.
    lessons:
      - Hiding problems destroys trust; honesty preserves it
      - Always pair bad news with clear analysis and plan
      - Prepare for tough questions with data
      - Specific asks turn board from judges to helpers

    name: "CEO Building Quarterly Reporting Rhythm for Growing Team"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: |
      100-person Series B company. Multiple board members, 20+ 
      investors. Quarterly reporting has been ad hoc. Need to 
      establish professional, scalable process.
    situation: |
      Company has grown but quarterly reporting is still CEO doing 
      everything the week before board meeting. Need to establish 
      process that involves leadership team and scales.
    trigger: |
      New COO joined and noted quarterly reporting is a scramble. CEO 
      agrees to establish proper process with clear ownership.
    actions: |
      1. Defined reporting calendar: locked board dates for year, 
         set milestones for data, deck, review, send.
      2. Assigned ownership: CFO owns financials, Head of Product 
         owns product metrics, Head of Sales owns pipeline section, 
         COO coordinates overall.
      3. Created templates: standardized deck template, investor 
         email template, data collection spreadsheet.
      4. Established review process: department heads submit sections 
         by week 2, CEO/COO review and integrate week 3, final polish 
         and send week 4.
      5. Built dashboard: automated data pull for key metrics so 
         quarterly compilation is faster.
      6. Implemented investor update system: segmented investor list 
         (board, major, minor), different detail levels per segment.
      7. Created feedback loop: post-board-meeting debrief to improve 
         next quarter.
      8. Documented process in internal wiki for continuity.
    outcome: |
      Quarterly reporting went from 15+ hours of CEO time to 4 hours 
      of CEO time with better quality. Leadership team more engaged 
      in board preparation. Investors commented on improved consistency 
      and quality. Process survived COO departure with documentation.
    lessons:
      - Process beats heroics for recurring tasks
      - Clear ownership prevents scrambles
      - Templates and automation reduce effort
      - Documentation ensures continuity

operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - Board meeting schedule established
    - Financial close process in place
    - Key metrics defined and tracked
    - Investor list and communication preferences
    
  common_blockers:
    - "Financials are not ready - Establish faster close process"
    - "Dont know what board wants - Ask them; most will tell you"
    - "Too busy running company - Delegate preparation; CEO finalizes"
    - "Bad news to deliver - Never hide; always surface with plan"
    
  integration_points:
    - Finance: Financial statements and metrics
    - Product: Product metrics and roadmap
    - Sales: Pipeline and revenue updates
    - HR: Team updates and org changes

risks:
  if_skipped: |
    Investor trust erodes. Board meetings become unproductive. 
    Problems surface late. Fundraising becomes harder. Lose investor 
    support when you need it most.
    
  if_over_engineered: |
    Spend too much time on reporting vs. running business. Create 
    analysis paralysis. Over-engineer decks that obscure key messages. 
    Lose authentic communication in process.
