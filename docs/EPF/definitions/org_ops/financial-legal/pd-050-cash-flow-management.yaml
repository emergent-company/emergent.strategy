# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-050-001
    name: "Unexpected Revenue Cliff with 6-Month Runway"
    practitioner: CEO at 40-person B2B SaaS
    organization_context: |
      Series A company with $3M ARR, growing 80% YoY. Largest customer (22% of 
      revenue) announced they're being acquired and will terminate contract in 
      90 days. No replacement revenue in pipeline. Current burn rate: $250K/month. 
      Cash: $1.5M. Runway just dropped from 12 months to 6.
    situation: |
      Tuesday morning—customer success escalates that Enterprise Corp's procurement 
      team called about contract termination. CEO confirms with champion: new parent 
      company has competitive solution. Non-negotiable. Lost $660K ARR overnight. 
      Board meeting in 2 weeks. Team doesn't know yet.
    trigger: |
      Email from Enterprise Corp's VP Procurement: "Per acquisition integration, 
      we will be transitioning to internal solutions. Please prepare offboarding."
    actions:
      - "Day 1: Verified with CFO—new runway is 6.1 months assuming no other changes"
      - "Day 1: Emergency leadership meeting—agreed on communication plan and immediate actions"
      - "Day 2: Built 3 cash scenarios: (1) current trajectory, (2) moderate cuts, (3) aggressive cuts"
      - "Day 3: Called 3 investors informally—gauged appetite for bridge funding or accelerated Series B"
      - "Day 4: Identified $80K/month in cuts that could extend runway without layoffs (marketing, contractors, unused software)"
      - "Day 5: Announced customer loss to company, immediate cost cuts, no layoffs but hiring freeze"
      - "Week 2: Accelerated pipeline deals—offered 20% annual prepay discount to 3 prospects"
      - "Week 3: Board meeting—presented situation, action plan, bridge funding request"
      - "Week 4-6: Closed 2 prepay deals ($240K cash in), executed cost cuts ($60K/month savings)"
      - "Week 8: Lead investor agreed to $500K bridge, extending runway to 10 months"
    outcome: |
      Avoided panic and layoffs through quick action. Runway extended from 6 to 
      10 months. Team rallied rather than scattered—appreciated transparency. 
      Lost one employee who was already looking. Cuts forced healthy discipline. 
      Bridge bought time to rebuild pipeline. Eventually replaced lost revenue 
      within 8 months. Learned that customer concentration is existential risk.
    lessons:
      - "Customer concentration is a cash flow time bomb—diversification is survival"
      - "Immediate cost cuts buy time even if revenue recovery takes longer"
      - "Transparency with team prevents rumors and departures from uncertainty"
      - "Prepay discounts trade margin for runway—valid survival tactic"
      - "Investor relationships matter most when you need bridge funding"

  - id: ps-050-002
    name: "Collections Crisis from Payment Processor Change"
    practitioner: CFO at 80-person marketplace startup
    organization_context: |
      Series B company processing $5M/month in GMV. Previous payment processor 
      (Stripe) had 2-day payout. Switched to new processor for lower fees (saving 
      $30K/month). New processor has 7-day payout plus $500K rolling reserve 
      requirement. Cash gap not modeled before switch.
    situation: |
      End of Q2, preparing for board meeting. CFO realizes company is $800K short 
      on next payroll (runs $1.2M/month). The $500K reserve was taken from operating 
      cash. The extra 5 days of float means $350K more stuck in transit at any time. 
      Previous float assumption was baked into all cash models. Payroll in 8 days.
    trigger: |
      Controller flagged: "We're going to miss payroll next week. The cash isn't there."
    actions:
      - "Hour 1-2: Verified math with controller—confirmed $800K gap, payroll in 8 days"
      - "Hour 3: Called new payment processor—negotiated reserve release of $200K (took 3 days)"
      - "Hour 4: Called bank about revolving credit line—emergency draw of $400K approved in 48 hours"
      - "Hour 5: Reviewed AR aging—found $180K in overdue invoices from enterprise clients"
      - "Day 2-3: CFO personally called 5 largest overdue accounts, collected $140K"
      - "Day 3: Drew on credit line, reserve released—payroll covered"
      - "Day 4: Rebuilt cash model with accurate float assumptions, presented to CEO"
      - "Week 2: Negotiated with new processor—reduced reserve to $300K based on history"
      - "Week 3: Board meeting—disclosed near-miss, new cash management protocols"
    outcome: |
      Made payroll with 2 days to spare. Exposed dangerous gap in cash modeling. 
      Credit line became permanent safety net ($500K maintained). Rebuilt 
      relationship with processor for better terms. The $30K/month savings 
      was real but nearly caused catastrophe. Installed weekly cash forecasting 
      as permanent practice. Never happened again.
    lessons:
      - "Payment processor changes have massive cash flow implications—model them"
      - "Reserves and float changes are real cash that disappears from operations"
      - "Credit lines are cheap insurance—establish before you need them"
      - "AR collections often have easy money sitting there—just need attention"
      - "Near-misses are gifts—the lesson comes without the consequence"

  - id: ps-050-003
    name: "Runway Extension Through Strategic Billing Change"
    practitioner: Head of Finance at 25-person dev tools company
    organization_context: |
      Seed-stage company with $1.2M in bank, $80K monthly burn. All customers 
      on monthly billing (~$60K MRR). Fundraising planned for Q4 but market is 
      tough—might take 6 months. Current runway: 15 months. But if fundraising 
      takes 6 months and bridge is needed, runway becomes uncomfortably short.
    situation: |
      March—CEO returns from failed fundraising conversations. "VCs want 6 more 
      months of traction before they'll invest." Current runway runs out in 
      January. Need to extend without cutting team (already lean at 25). 
      Revenue is growing but not fast enough to reach profitability.
    trigger: |
      CEO asked Head of Finance: "How do we buy ourselves 6 more months without 
      layoffs?" Finance had been thinking about billing structure change.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Analyzed customer base—80 customers, 40% on monthly, 60% on month-to-month annual"
      - "Week 1: Modeled annual prepay scenario—if 50% of customers switched to annual prepay, $180K cash in"
      - "Week 2: Designed annual billing incentive—2 months free for annual prepay (17% discount)"
      - "Week 3: Customer success team contacted all monthly customers with annual offer"
      - "Week 4-6: 35 customers converted to annual prepay, generating $210K in immediate cash"
      - "Week 6: Negotiated with AWS for startup credits extension—got $50K additional"
      - "Week 7-10: Implemented annual-only pricing for new customers"
      - "Week 10: Updated financial model—runway extended from 15 to 19 months"
    outcome: |
      Extended runway by 4 months through billing change alone. The discount cost 
      future revenue but survival trumped margin. Annual customers also had lower 
      churn (commitment effect). Fundraising eventually happened in Q4 as planned—
      extra runway reduced desperation and improved negotiating position. 
      Company never returned to monthly billing as default.
    lessons:
      - "Billing structure is a cash flow lever—annual prepay is cheap debt"
      - "Customers often prefer annual pricing for simplicity and savings"
      - "Runway extension without cost cuts is possible through creative finance"
      - "Extra runway improves fundraising psychology—desperation shows"
      - "One-time cash acceleration beats ongoing cost cuts when you need time"

# ============================================================
# RISKS
# ============================================================
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: Forecast is inaccurate
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Use rolling 13-week forecast updated weekly, build in scenarios (best/base/worst), track forecast vs actual to improve accuracy"
    
    - risk: AR not collected timely
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Implement aging reports reviewed weekly, escalation process for overdue, consider AR financing for large invoices"
    
    - risk: Unexpected large expenses
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Maintain expense calendar with known large payments, require finance approval for unbudgeted expenses, keep minimum 2-month buffer"
    
    - risk: Bank issues or delayed transfers
      likelihood: low
      impact: critical
      mitigation: "Maintain relationships with multiple banks, have backup wire capability, never rely on single account for payroll"
    
    - risk: Runway calculation assumptions wrong
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Use realistic burn (not optimistic), include all committed expenses, recalculate with each material change"

  organizational_risks:
    - risk: Team unaware of cash constraints
      impact: "Spending decisions made without visibility into runway, hiring commitments exceed capacity, leaders surprised by sudden cuts"
      prevention: "Share runway with leadership team, budget ownership by department, monthly cash review in leadership meeting"
    
    - risk: Customer concentration in AR
      impact: "Single customer delay or loss creates immediate cash crisis, dependency invisible until failure"
      prevention: "Monitor customer concentration monthly, diversify revenue, consider credit insurance for large accounts"
    
    - risk: Board/investors surprised by cash position
      impact: "Damages trust, makes fundraising harder, suggests financial incompetence"
      prevention: "Monthly cash updates to board, flag concerns early (6+ months before crisis), never surprise investors"

# ============================================================
# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Cash flow management has professionalized dramatically in the startup 
    ecosystem. The "grow at all costs" era gave way to "efficient growth" 
    after 2022 market correction. VCs now expect detailed 13-week cash 
    forecasts and clear runway visibility before investing.
    
    Modern treasury tools (Ramp, Brex, Mercury) provide real-time cash 
    visibility that was impossible 5 years ago. Integration with accounting 
    software enables automated forecasting. But tools don't replace judgment—
    understanding what the numbers mean and when to act remains human work.
    
    The shift to recurring revenue models (SaaS) has made cash more 
    predictable but also created new risks (churn concentration, payment 
    processor dependencies). Annual billing has become the norm for capital 
    efficiency. Revenue-based financing offers non-dilutive options for 
    extending runway.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "13-week rolling cash forecast"
      description: "Week-by-week cash projection updated weekly, tracking receipts and payments separately"
      evidence: "Standard for institutional investors, required by most VCs for portfolio companies"
    
    - practice: "Scenario planning"
      description: "Maintain best/base/worst case scenarios, know triggers for each"
      evidence: "Companies with scenario models react 2-3 months faster to changing conditions"
    
    - practice: "Credit line establishment"
      description: "Establish revolving credit facility before you need it—costs little unused"
      evidence: "Banks won't lend when you're desperate; credit lines established early provide cheap insurance"
    
    - practice: "AR aging management"
      description: "Weekly review of receivables, systematic follow-up process, escalation for overdue"
      evidence: "Active AR management reduces DSO by 10-20 days, directly improving cash position"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Checking balance, not forecasting"
      description: "Knowing current cash but not projecting forward, living day-to-day"
      consequence: "Crises hit without warning, no time to act, forced into desperate measures"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Optimistic revenue assumptions"
      description: "Forecasting cash based on pipeline, not closed revenue"
      consequence: "Runway overstated, false confidence, crisis when deals slip"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Ignoring float and timing"
      description: "Not accounting for payment processing time, bank transfers, payroll timing"
      consequence: "Paper cash exists but real cash isn't available when needed"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Waiting for crisis to cut"
      description: "Continuing to spend until cash is critical, then panic cutting"
      consequence: "Cuts are deeper and more damaging than proactive right-sizing"
