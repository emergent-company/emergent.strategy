definition:
  purpose: |
    Intellectual property is often a startup's most valuable asset. 
    Without proper protection, IP can be lost to former employees, 
    contractors, or competitors. A good IP program protects what 
    you've created and respects others' IP.
    
  outcome: |
    Company owns IP created by employees and contractors. Trade 
    secrets are protected. Trademarks are registered. Patent 
    strategy exists (if applicable). Third-party IP is properly used.
