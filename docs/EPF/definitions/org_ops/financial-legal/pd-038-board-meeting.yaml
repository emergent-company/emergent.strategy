definition:
  purpose: |
    The board provides governance, oversight, and strategic counsel. 
    Ineffective board meetings waste everyone's time and miss the 
    opportunity for valuable input. A good board process maximizes 
    the value of board time.
    
  outcome: |
    Board is informed about company performance. Strategic decisions 
    get board input. Required governance is completed. CEO gets 
    valuable counsel. Board members are engaged.

# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-038-001
    name: "First Formal Board Meeting After Seed Round"
    practitioner: CEO at 15-person startup
    organization_context: |
      Just closed $3M seed round with 2 institutional investors. Lead investor 
      wants quarterly board meetings. CEO has never run a formal board before—
      previous investor was an angel who just wanted occasional coffee chats. 
      Now there's a 5-person board: 2 founders, 2 investors, 1 independent.
    situation: |
      First quarterly board meeting is in 3 weeks. CEO has no idea what to 
      prepare. Lead investor sent a list of "things we typically see" but 
      it feels overwhelming. CTO asks: "Do I need to present? What do boards 
      actually want?" Team is nervous about investor oversight.
    trigger: |
      Lead investor email: "Looking forward to our first board meeting. 
      Please send materials by Friday the week before. Let me know if you 
      have questions about the agenda."
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Called lead investor for 30-min prep call—asked what they really care about (runway, growth, hiring)"
      - "Week 1: Found 3 board deck examples from other portfolio companies (investor shared template)"
      - "Week 2: Built deck: exec summary (1), metrics (2), strategic topic (4), team update (1), financials (2), asks (1)"
      - "Week 2: Chose strategic topic: 'Should we focus on SMB or Enterprise?' (real decision needing input)"
      - "Week 2: CTO prepared 1-slide product update for appendix (referenced but not presented)"
      - "Week 3: Sent materials 7 days early with clear asks: 'Please review slides 4-7 for discussion'"
      - "Week 3: Had 15-min pre-call with independent director to set context (first time meeting him)"
      - "Meeting day: Started on time, kept updates to 20 min, spent 60 min on strategic discussion"
      - "Same week: Sent minutes within 48 hours, scheduled 1:1 with each director for relationship building"
    outcome: |
      Meeting went well. Directors appreciated concise updates and real strategic 
      discussion. SMB vs Enterprise decision got genuinely useful input—they'd 
      seen this pattern before. Lead investor said it was "one of the better 
      first boards" they'd attended. Established pattern for future meetings. 
      CEO realized board can be genuinely helpful, not just oversight.
    lessons:
      - "Ask investors what they care about—they'll tell you"
      - "One real strategic discussion is more valuable than 10 slides of updates"
      - "Pre-calls with individual directors build relationships and surface concerns"
      - "Send materials early—rushed prep shows"
      - "Minutes within 48 hours demonstrate professionalism"

  - id: ps-038-002
    name: "Delivering Bad News to the Board"
    practitioner: CEO at 60-person Series A company
    organization_context: |
      Hit targets for first 4 quarters post-funding. Board relationship is 
      good but based on consistent delivery. Q5 was a disaster: missed revenue 
      by 35%, largest customer churned, VP Sales quit. Board meeting in 2 weeks. 
      CEO dreading it—first time delivering genuinely bad news.
    situation: |
      Metrics are ugly. No way to spin them. Lead investor has seen the 
      monthly update but formal board meeting will force detailed discussion. 
      CEO worried about losing board confidence. CFO asks: "How do we present 
      this without looking incompetent?" Team morale already shaky.
    trigger: |
      Monthly investor update sent with bad numbers. Lead investor responded: 
      "Let's discuss at the board meeting. Please come with a clear analysis 
      of what happened and your plan forward."
    actions:
      - "Day 1: Acknowledged temptation to minimize—decided on full transparency instead"
      - "Days 2-3: Built honest analysis: what happened, why, what we missed, what we learned"
      - "Day 3: Drafted 3 scenarios: (1) current trajectory, (2) with changes, (3) aggressive pivot"
      - "Day 4: Called lead investor before formal materials—no surprises in board meeting"
      - "Day 5: Called other board members individually with heads-up (30 min each)"
      - "Day 7: Sent materials: 2 slides on what happened, 3 slides on root cause analysis, 4 slides on recovery plan"
      - "Board meeting: CEO owned the miss personally, didn't blame departed VP Sales"
      - "Board meeting: Presented recovery plan with milestones, asked board for help with recruiting and introductions"
      - "Post-meeting: Weekly update cadence for 90 days (increased from monthly)"
    outcome: |
      Board appreciated honesty. Lead investor said: "Every portfolio company 
      hits tough patches. How you handle it determines whether we lose or 
      gain confidence." Got useful input on recovery plan. Board helped recruit 
      new VP Sales through their networks. Relationship actually strengthened 
      through adversity. Recovery took 2 quarters but board remained supportive.
    lessons:
      - "Never surprise the board—individual calls before the meeting"
      - "Own the miss personally—don't blame departed employees or circumstances"
      - "Boards have seen this before—they judge response, not just results"
      - "Come with analysis AND plan—don't just present problems"
      - "Increased transparency during difficult periods builds trust"

  - id: ps-038-003
    name: "Managing Board Disagreement on Strategic Direction"
    practitioner: CEO at 120-person Series B company
    organization_context: |
      Two strong-willed investors on board with different philosophies. Lead 
      Series A investor is "grow at all costs" mindset. Series B investor joined 
      in 2022 during market correction, wants path to profitability. Every 
      board meeting becomes a debate between them. CEO caught in the middle.
    situation: |
      Planning 2024 budget. Company is at $15M ARR, burning $1.5M/month. 
      Series A investor wants aggressive hiring plan to reach $30M. Series B 
      investor wants break-even within 18 months. Both have legitimate points. 
      CEO needs to make a decision but board can't agree.
    trigger: |
      Last board meeting ended without resolution on budget. Series B investor 
      said: "If you present an aggressive hiring plan, I'll vote against it." 
      Series A investor said: "If you present a defensive plan, we'll never 
      hit escape velocity."
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Individual calls with both investors to deeply understand their concerns"
      - "Week 1: Realized Series A worried about competitive window, Series B worried about runway"
      - "Week 2: Built hybrid scenario that addressed both concerns: 'Growth + Optionality'"
      - "Week 2: Plan showed aggressive growth investments that could be reversed if metrics didn't hit"
      - "Week 2: Included trigger points: 'If X metric by Month 6, we accelerate; if not, we cut'"
      - "Week 3: Shared draft with independent director first—got her buy-in and coaching"
      - "Week 3: Pre-wired both investors: 'I've built a plan that I think addresses your concerns'"
      - "Board meeting: Presented as CEO recommendation, not compromise—owned the plan"
      - "Board meeting: Asked each investor to share concerns, facilitated discussion rather than debate"
      - "Outcome: Board approved plan with quarterly checkpoints"
    outcome: |
      Plan passed unanimously. CEO reestablished themselves as the decision-maker, 
      not just a mediator between investors. Quarterly checkpoints gave both 
      investors what they needed—Series A got growth bets, Series B got off-ramps. 
      Pattern of pre-wiring and facilitated discussion became standard for 
      contentious topics. Independent director became valuable ally.
    lessons:
      - "Understand investor concerns deeply—often not as opposed as they seem"
      - "Build plans with optionality to bridge philosophical differences"
      - "CEO must own the decision—presenting as your recommendation, not a compromise"
      - "Pre-wire difficult topics—no surprises in the board room"
      - "Independent directors can be tiebreakers and allies—cultivate those relationships"

# RISKS
# ============================================================
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: Materials not ready or too late
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Calendar time for prep 2 weeks before, template that's reusable, draft shared with CFO early"
    
    - risk: Meeting becomes operational, not strategic
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Limit updates to 20 min, require strategic topic on every agenda, push details to appendix"
    
    - risk: Board members don't read pre-read
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Send materials 7 days early with clear 'must read' flags, assume some won't read and summarize key points"
    
    - risk: Meeting runs over time
      likelihood: high
      impact: low
      mitigation: "Strict timekeeping, move unfinished items to follow-up, schedule strategic topic early"
    
    - risk: Action items not tracked or completed
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Capture action items in meeting, send minutes within 48 hours, review open items at next meeting"

  organizational_risks:
    - risk: Board loses confidence in management
      impact: "Eroded trust leads to micromanagement, CEO replacement risk, difficult future fundraising"
      prevention: "Consistent communication, early warning on problems, demonstrate learning from mistakes, build individual relationships"
    
    - risk: Board becomes rubber stamp or adversarial
      impact: "Either extreme wastes the resource—rubber stamp provides no value, adversarial creates friction"
      prevention: "Bring real decisions for input, welcome constructive challenge, separate governance from strategic discussion"
    
    - risk: Information asymmetry creates surprises
      impact: "Board feels blindsided, trust damaged, leads to increased reporting burden"
      prevention: "Regular investor updates between meetings, individual director calls, proactive communication on changes"

# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Board governance in startups has professionalized significantly. The "three 
    people in a coffee shop" board of the 2010s has given way to more structured 
    governance, driven by larger funding rounds, increased regulatory scrutiny, 
    and lessons from high-profile governance failures.
    
    Best-in-class board practices now emphasize strategic discussion over 
    operational updates, pre-read materials, and productive use of limited 
    director time. The shift to digital tools (Carta, Pulley for cap tables; 
    Diligent, BoardVantage for board management) has enabled better information 
    sharing and compliance.
    
    Independent directors are increasingly common even at Series A, providing 
    balance and outside perspective. The role of the board has evolved from 
    pure oversight to include coaching, network access, and pattern recognition 
    from portfolio experience.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Strategic focus (50%+ of meeting time)"
      description: "Dedicate majority of meeting to discussion, not reporting"
      evidence: "High-performing boards spend 60%+ of time on forward-looking strategic discussion"
    
    - practice: "Pre-read materials 7 days early"
      description: "Send complete materials a full week before the meeting"
      evidence: "Directors report being better prepared and meetings more productive with 7-day lead time"
    
    - practice: "Individual director relationships"
      description: "CEO maintains 1:1 relationship with each director between meetings"
      evidence: "CEOs with regular director 1:1s report better board dynamics and more useful input"
    
    - practice: "Consent agenda for routine items"
      description: "Bundle routine approvals (option grants, minutes) for single vote"
      evidence: "Consent agendas free 15-20 minutes per meeting for strategic discussion"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Reading the slides"
      description: "CEO presents every slide line by line, no discussion"
      consequence: "Wastes director time, no strategic input, board disengages"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Hiding bad news"
      description: "Minimizing or delaying communication of problems"
      consequence: "Board eventually discovers, trust permanently damaged, recovery harder"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Last-minute materials"
      description: "Sending deck the night before or at the meeting"
      consequence: "Directors can't prepare, meeting is less productive, appears unprofessional"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Treating board as adversary"
      description: "Defensive posture, minimizing information, avoiding difficult topics"
      consequence: "Board can't help, relationship becomes transactional, missed opportunity"

  benchmarks:
