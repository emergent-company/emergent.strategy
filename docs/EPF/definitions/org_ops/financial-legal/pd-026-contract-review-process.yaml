definition:
  purpose: |
    Contracts create legal obligations. Signing without review creates risk. 
    But over-lawyering everything slows business. A good contract review 
    process balances risk management with business velocity.
    
  outcome: |
    Contracts are reviewed before signing. Key risks are identified and 
    addressed. Terms are documented. Signatures are properly authorized. 
    Contracts are stored and trackable.
