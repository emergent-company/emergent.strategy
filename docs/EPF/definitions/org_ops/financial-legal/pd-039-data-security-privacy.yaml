# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-039-001
    name: "Building Security Foundation for Series A Company"
    practitioner: CTO at 22-person startup
    organization_context: |
      B2B SaaS company, just closed Series A. Enterprise prospects asking 
      for security questionnaires. Currently security is ad hoc—passwords 
      in Slack, laptops not encrypted, no formal policies. Need to build 
      credible security posture without dedicated security hire.
    situation: |
      Largest prospect ($200K ACV) sent 180-question security questionnaire. 
      Honest answers would be embarrassing. CEO says: "We need to fix this, 
      but we can't afford a security team." CTO realizes security debt is 
      now blocking revenue, not just a theoretical risk.
    trigger: |
      Prospect deadline: 2 weeks to return questionnaire or lose the deal. 
      Current state: can't pass without lying. CTO commits to 90-day 
      security improvement plan with immediate high-impact changes.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Audit current state—created spreadsheet of all security gaps (38 items)"
      - "Week 1: Prioritized gaps by impact (blocks enterprise sales) and effort (can fix in days)"
      - "Week 1: Immediate fixes: enforced MFA everywhere, encrypted all laptops, removed shared credentials"
      - "Week 2: Deployed Vanta (security compliance automation) to systematize tracking"
      - "Week 2: Wrote basic policies: acceptable use, password requirements, data handling"
      - "Week 2: Conducted first access review—found 3 ex-employees still had access"
      - "Week 3-4: Implemented SOC 2 Type 1 readiness checklist using Vanta guidance"
      - "Month 2: Basic security training for all employees (1 hour)"
      - "Month 3: First penetration test by external firm, remediated critical findings"
      - "Month 3: Started SOC 2 Type 1 audit process"
    outcome: |
      Within 4 weeks, could honestly answer 85% of security questionnaire 
      items. Won the enterprise deal. SOC 2 Type 1 certification achieved 
      at month 6. Security questions in sales cycle reduced from blocker 
      to checkbox. Zero security incidents. Cost: $30K for Vanta + audit 
      vs. $150K+ for dedicated security hire.
    lessons:
      - "Enterprise sales often drives security investment—tie it to revenue"
      - "SOC 2 Type 1 is achievable without dedicated security team"
      - "Automation platforms (Vanta, Drata, Secureframe) accelerate dramatically"
      - "Start with high-impact basics: MFA, encryption, access reviews"
      - "Policy doesn't mean bureaucracy—simple, enforced policies work"

  - id: ps-039-002
    name: "Responding to First Data Breach"
    practitioner: CEO at 40-person company
    organization_context: |
      B2B company handling customer data. Has basic security policies and 
      SOC 2 Type 1. No previous security incidents. Security is owned by 
      CTO but no dedicated security team. Customers include mid-market 
      companies with their own security requirements.
    situation: |
      Friday 4pm: CTO notices unusual database access patterns. Investigation 
      reveals: attacker accessed production database through compromised 
      developer credentials. Unknown what data was accessed or exfiltrated. 
      Customer PII potentially exposed. CEO has never managed a breach before.
    trigger: |
      CTO calls CEO: "We have a problem. I think we've been breached. I'm 
      still investigating but wanted you to know immediately." CEO realizes 
      this is the worst-case scenario they abstractly prepared for.
    actions:
      - "Hour 1: Assembled incident response team (CEO, CTO, legal counsel on retainer, outside cyber counsel)"
      - "Hour 2: Contained incident—rotated compromised credentials, blocked attacker access"
      - "Hour 4: Began forensic analysis—what data was accessed, timeframe, scope"
      - "Day 1: Engaged cyber insurance carrier (they provided breach response team)"
      - "Day 1: Legal counsel assessed notification obligations (GDPR, state laws, customer contracts)"
      - "Day 2: Forensics confirmed scope: 2,400 customer records accessed, subset with PII"
      - "Day 2: Drafted customer notification with legal review"
      - "Day 3: CEO personally called top 10 customers before mass notification"
      - "Day 3: Sent breach notification to all affected customers with credit monitoring offer"
      - "Week 2: Completed remediation (new access controls, enhanced monitoring)"
      - "Week 3: Published incident post-mortem (internal and customer-facing)"
    outcome: |
      Transparency preserved customer relationships—no major customers 
      churned. CEO's personal calls to top customers were appreciated. 
      Cyber insurance covered breach response costs ($180K for forensics, 
      legal, credit monitoring). Implemented enhanced security: privileged 
      access management, real-time alerting. One year later, passed SOC 2 
      Type 2 with no breach-related findings.
    lessons:
      - "Speed of response matters—hours, not days"
      - "Cyber insurance pays for itself in one incident (if you have it)"
      - "Personal outreach to key customers before mass notification builds trust"
      - "Transparency about breach actually increases customer confidence in recovery"
      - "Breach becomes catalyst for security improvements you should have made earlier"

  - id: ps-039-003
    name: "GDPR Compliance Under Customer Pressure"
    practitioner: VP Operations at 55-person company
    organization_context: |
      US-based B2B SaaS company with 30% of revenue from EU customers. 
      Never focused on GDPR—assumed it was "just for big companies." 
      Data practices are informal: collect what might be useful, keep 
      everything, no documented data processing agreements.
    situation: |
      Largest EU customer (15% of revenue) is renewing. Their procurement 
      team sends GDPR compliance requirements as condition of renewal: 
      Data Processing Agreement (DPA), documented sub-processors, proof 
      of data handling procedures. Current state doesn't meet requirements.
    trigger: |
      Customer's data protection officer emails: "We need signed DPA and 
      documentation of your GDPR compliance before renewal. Deadline: 6 weeks." 
      Renewal is $400K ARR. VP Operations realizes GDPR has moved from 
      "theoretical requirement" to "revenue-blocking reality."
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Engaged privacy counsel to assess current gaps and build remediation plan"
      - "Week 1: Documented all data flows—what customer data, where stored, who accesses, why"
      - "Week 1: Identified all sub-processors (AWS, Stripe, Intercom, etc.)"
      - "Week 2: Drafted DPA based on Standard Contractual Clauses (counsel review)"
      - "Week 2: Created sub-processor list with GDPR commitments from each vendor"
      - "Week 3: Implemented data subject request process (access, deletion, portability)"
      - "Week 3: Documented legal bases for processing (contract necessity, legitimate interest)"
      - "Week 4: Updated privacy policy to include GDPR-required disclosures"
      - "Week 4: Conducted data minimization review—stopped collecting unnecessary data"
      - "Week 5: Internal training on GDPR requirements for customer-facing teams"
      - "Week 6: Sent documentation package to customer, scheduled call with their DPO"
    outcome: |
      Customer DPO approved compliance package with minor revisions. Renewal 
      closed on time. Invested $25K in legal and consulting, but now have 
      reusable GDPR framework. Next 3 EU customers received same package, 
      no additional work. GDPR compliance became sales asset, not liability. 
      Identified 2 sub-processors who weren't GDPR compliant—switched vendors.
    lessons:
      - "Customer pressure often drives compliance investment—tie to revenue"
      - "GDPR isn't optional if you have EU customers—it's contract requirement"
      - "Document once, reuse many times—DPA and processes scale to all EU customers"
      - "Sub-processor compliance is your responsibility—audit vendor commitments"
      - "Compliance work has secondary benefits: better data hygiene, clear processes"

      prevention: "Proactive compliance investment (SOC 2, GDPR), security as sales enablement"
    
    - risk: Security team becomes blocker
      impact: "Security slows development, creates friction, developers work around security"
      prevention: "Security enables rather than blocks, developer-friendly tools, shift left approach"

# ============================================================
# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Startup security has evolved from afterthought to board-level concern. 
    The shift accelerated with high-profile breaches at well-funded companies, 
    increased regulatory requirements (GDPR, CCPA, industry regulations), 
    and enterprise customer security demands.
    
    The emergence of security compliance automation platforms (Vanta, Drata, 
    Secureframe) has made SOC 2 achievable for companies without dedicated 
    security teams. What previously required $200K+ in consulting now costs 
    $15-30K/year in software.
    
    Zero-trust security models are becoming standard, assuming breach is 
    inevitable and designing systems accordingly. Identity-first security 
    (strong authentication, least privilege, continuous verification) has 
    replaced perimeter-based approaches.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "MFA everywhere, no exceptions"
      description: "Require multi-factor authentication on all systems, all users"
      evidence: "MFA prevents 99.9% of account compromise attacks per Microsoft security research"
    
    - practice: "Least privilege access"
      description: "Users get minimum access needed, reviewed quarterly"
      evidence: "Reduces blast radius of any compromise, limits insider threat exposure"
    
    - practice: "Security as enabler, not blocker"
      description: "Frame security investments as revenue enablers (enterprise sales) and risk reduction"
      evidence: "Companies that position security positively report 2x higher developer compliance"
    
    - practice: "Incident response readiness"
      description: "Documented plan, assigned roles, regular practice"
      evidence: "Companies with tested incident response plans contain breaches 2.5x faster"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Security through obscurity"
      description: "Hiding security practices rather than building robust controls"
      consequence: "Falls apart under scrutiny, single point of failure"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Compliance checkbox mentality"
      description: "Doing minimum to pass audit without improving actual security"
      consequence: "Audit passes but real vulnerabilities remain, false sense of security"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Blaming users for security failures"
      description: "Punishing employees for clicking phishing links rather than improving controls"
      consequence: "Underreporting of incidents, culture of hiding rather than fixing"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Post-breach panic investment"
      description: "Ignoring security until breach, then overinvesting in reactive measures"
      consequence: "Damage already done, investment often misdirected, could have been prevented cheaper"

  benchmarks:
    - metric: "Time to detect breach"
      top_quartile: "<24 hours"
