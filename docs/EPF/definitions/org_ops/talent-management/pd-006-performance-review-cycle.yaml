definition:
  purpose: |
    Without structured performance feedback, employees lack clarity on expectations, 
    growth areas, and recognition for achievements. This leads to disengagement and 
    surprise terminations. Regular performance reviews create alignment and support 
    professional development.
    
  outcome: |
    Each employee has received clear feedback on their performance, understands 
    their strengths and development areas, and has documented goals for the 
    upcoming period.

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "First-time manager delivering difficult feedback"
    practitioner: "Engineering Manager (first-time manager)"
    organization_context: "25-person Series A startup, informal culture, first formal review cycle"
    situation: |
      Jake has been a manager for 6 months after being promoted from senior engineer. He needs 
      to give his first performance review to Alex, a mid-level engineer who is technically 
      competent but has collaboration issues - interrupts in meetings, dismisses others' ideas, 
      and several teammates have complained privately. Jake has avoided addressing this because 
      Alex ships code fast and Jake isn't sure how to have the conversation.
    trigger: "Annual review cycle begins, Jake realizes he can't avoid the feedback any longer"
    actions: |
      1. Jake reviews the review template and realizes he needs specific examples. Searches 
         Slack/email for concrete instances of problematic behavior - finds 4 specific examples.
      2. Asks HR for guidance on delivering difficult feedback. Gets coaching on framing 
         (impact, not judgment) and the "situation-behavior-impact" model.
      3. Prepares review document: acknowledges Alex's technical strengths strongly, then 
         addresses collaboration with specific examples and impact on team.
      4. During review meeting, leads with genuine appreciation for Alex's contributions. 
         Then says "I also need to share feedback that's harder to hear..."
      5. Alex initially defensive ("That's just how I communicate"). Jake stays calm, 
         shares specific impact ("When you interrupted Maya's design proposal, she stopped 
         contributing for the rest of the meeting").
      6. Shifts to forward-looking: "What would help you pause before responding in meetings?"
      7. Agrees on specific goal: "In next quarter, aim for zero interruptions in design 
         reviews, and actively ask at least one question to understand others' perspectives."
    outcome: |
      Alex was initially upset but acknowledged the feedback after a day of reflection. 
      Over the next quarter, behavior improved significantly. Jake learned that specific 
      examples are essential and that avoiding feedback makes it harder, not easier.
    lessons:
      - "Document specific examples throughout the year - vague feedback fails"
      - "Difficult feedback is kinder than avoidance (problem compounds over time)"
      - "Lead with genuine strengths, then transition clearly to growth areas"
      - "Focus on observable behavior and impact, not personality judgments"
      - "Forward-looking goals make feedback actionable, not just critical"

    name: "Running calibration to address grade inflation"
    practitioner: "VP of Engineering"
    organization_context: "80-person Series B, 6 engineering managers, no prior calibration"
    situation: |
      Sarah (VP Eng) noticed that last cycle, 85% of engineers were rated "Exceeds 
      Expectations" - which dilutes the meaning of the rating and creates unfairness. 
      Some managers are harsher than others. Two high performers are frustrated that 
      their ratings look the same as average performers. Sarah needs to introduce 
      calibration without making managers feel attacked.
    trigger: "Complaints from top performers + realization that ratings have lost meaning"
    actions: |
      1. Sarah meets with HR to design calibration process. Agrees on forced distribution 
         guidance: "expect ~10-15% exceptional, ~70% meets/good, ~15-20% needs development."
      2. Sends pre-work to managers: prepare 2-minute summary of each report's review 
         and proposed rating, with justification.
      3. Runs 3-hour calibration session: each manager presents, group discusses, 
         challenges, adjusts. Sarah facilitates to keep focus on consistency, not 
         defending turf.
      4. Key discussion: two managers rated similar-sounding engineers differently. 
         Group identifies that Manager A has higher bar. Recalibrate to shared standard.
      5. Addresses the "everyone is exceptional" pattern directly: "If everyone exceeds 
         expectations, our expectations are wrong. Let's use 'meets' as a good outcome."
      6. After calibration, some ratings adjusted up/down. Managers given talking points 
         for explaining rating to employees.
      7. Sarah commits to quarterly skip-levels to spot-check feedback quality.
    outcome: |
      Rating distribution shifted to 15% exceptional, 72% meets/good, 13% needs development. 
      Top performers felt appropriately recognized. Two managers initially resistant but 
      appreciated the shared standards. Calibration now a standard part of review process.
    lessons:
      - "Calibration requires advance prep - managers need to come ready to present"
      - "Frame calibration as 'fairness and consistency' not 'lowering ratings'"
      - "Shared examples surface inconsistent standards - this is the point"
      - "'Meets expectations' should be positioned as a good outcome, not mediocre"
      - "Forced distribution is guidance, not a strict quota"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Shifting to continuous feedback (breaking the annual cycle)"
    practitioner: "Chief People Officer"
    organization_context: "200-person growth-stage company, feedback happens only during annual reviews"
    situation: |
      Lisa (CPO) sees a recurring problem: employees are surprised by annual review 
      feedback, managers are doing "feedback dump" once a year, and the process feels 
      bureaucratic rather than developmental. She wants to shift to continuous feedback 
      but knows that "more meetings" will face resistance. Also, removing annual reviews 
      entirely would create compliance and compensation concerns.
    trigger: "Exit interview reveals 3 departing employees felt blindsided by performance concerns"
    actions: |
      1. Lisa researches continuous performance models (OKRs, weekly 1:1s, ongoing 
         feedback). Decides on hybrid: keep annual review but add quarterly check-ins.
      2. Reframes annual review as "comprehensive summary" not "reveal." Message: 
         "Nothing in your annual review should be a surprise because we discuss it quarterly."
      3. Introduces quarterly "growth conversations" template: 30-min check-in on goals, 
         feedback (both directions), and development. Not a formal review - just structured 1:1.
      4. Trains managers on the new rhythm: "The annual review documents what you've 
         already discussed. The quarterly check-ins are where real development happens."
      5. Implements in Lattice: quarterly prompts to managers, easy documentation, 
         rolls into annual summary view.
      6. Tracks adoption: first quarter, 60% of managers complete quarterly check-ins. 
         Publishes leaderboard. Q2 reaches 85%.
      7. After 1 year: annual review completion time dropped (less to write because 
         documented quarterly), employee surprise scores dropped from 25% to 8%.
    outcome: |
      Employees reported feeling "more supported" (engagement score up 12 points on 
      "my manager helps me grow"). Managers initially complained about "more process" 
      but eventually preferred it because annual reviews became easier. Three fewer 
      surprise terminations the following year.
    lessons:
      - "Annual reviews can coexist with continuous feedback - they become summaries"
      - "Reframe the cadence as 'no surprises' not 'more meetings'"
      - "Start with quarterly, not weekly - it's less threatening"
      - "Tool support (Lattice, 15Five) makes adoption much easier"
      - "Measure adoption in early quarters - managers need accountability"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Manager avoids giving difficult feedback - sugarcoats or omits"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Train managers on feedback delivery. Require calibration sessions where peers 
        hear each other's ratings and rationale. HR review of reviews for language that 
        doesn't match rating. Make clear that avoiding feedback is a management failure.
        
    - risk: "Recency bias - last month dominates full-year review"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Encourage quarterly notes or use tools that prompt ongoing feedback logging. 
        In review template, explicitly ask for examples across the review period, not 
        just recent. Manager training on recency bias.
        
    - risk: "Grade inflation - everyone rated 'exceeds expectations'"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Implement calibration sessions across managers. Provide distribution guidance 
        (not strict quotas). Frame 'meets expectations' as a positive outcome. Address 
        at leadership level if pattern persists.
        
    - risk: "Review conversation becomes one-way lecture"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Train managers on dialogue skills. Include employee self-assessment. Template 
        includes space for employee response. Start with "what feedback do you have for me?"
        
    - risk: "Timeline slips - reviews not completed on schedule"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Set firm deadlines with consequences (e.g., no bonus/promo processing until 
        review complete). Daily reminders in final week. Executive sponsor pushes from top.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Documentation used against company in wrongful termination lawsuit"
      impact: |
        If an employee with positive reviews is later terminated for performance, 
        inconsistent documentation becomes plaintiff's exhibit A. Conversely, lack 
        of documented feedback makes it hard to justify termination decisions.
      prevention: |
        Reviews must be honest - positive reviews for poor performers are a liability. 
        Document specific performance issues when they exist. Ensure review language 
        matches rating. HR reviews all reviews for legal exposure.
        
    - risk: "Surprise feedback damages trust and causes attrition"
      impact: |
        When employees are blindsided by negative reviews (no prior indication of issues), 
        it signals broken management relationship. Top performers may leave; trust is 
        damaged across the org if word spreads.
      prevention: |
        Train managers that feedback in annual review should never be new. Implement 
        quarterly check-ins or 1:1 feedback rhythms. Survey employees on "how surprised 
        were you by your review?" and act on results.
        
    - risk: "Review process perceived as bureaucratic checkbox exercise"
      impact: |
        If reviews feel like paperwork rather than development, they lose value. 
        Employees become cynical, managers rush through, the process becomes compliance-only. 
        This drives disengagement.
      prevention: |
        Keep process simple, especially at Tier 1. Focus on conversation quality over 
        form completeness. Include forward-looking development (not just backward-looking 
        evaluation). Train managers on why this matters, not just how to complete forms.

# Domain Context - Industry Best Practices and Benchmarks
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Performance management has undergone significant transformation in the past decade. 
    Traditional annual reviews are increasingly supplemented or replaced by continuous 
    feedback models. Adobe famously eliminated annual reviews in 2012, followed by GE, 
    Accenture, and Microsoft. However, most companies still need some form of periodic 
    summary for compensation decisions and documentation.
    
    The trend is toward: (1) more frequent, lighter-weight check-ins, (2) separation of 
    development feedback from compensation decisions, (3) peer feedback integration, 
    and (4) goal-tracking technology. Despite this, research shows that many employees 
    (especially in smaller companies) still receive little to no formal feedback - 
    creating huge opportunity for companies that get this right.
    
    Key challenge: manager skill. The process is only as good as the conversation. 
    Most managers receive little training on feedback delivery, and many avoid difficult 
    conversations. Building manager capability is as important as building the process.

  best_practices:
    - "No surprises: annual review should document what's been discussed throughout year"
    - "Lead with strengths: start with genuine appreciation before development feedback"
    - "Specific examples: vague feedback ('communicate better') is useless"
    - "Behavior + impact: focus on observable actions and their effect, not personality"
    - "Forward-looking goals: end with 'what's next' not just 'what happened'"
    - "Two-way conversation: employee perspective matters, not just manager assessment"
    - "Calibration across managers: ensure consistent standards and address grade inflation"
    - "Separate development from compensation: conflating them distorts both conversations"
    - "Document honestly: positive reviews for poor performers create legal exposure"
    
  anti_patterns:
    - "Recency bias: review dominated by last 4 weeks, ignoring rest of year"
    - "Feedback dump: saving all feedback for annual review instead of ongoing"
    - "Sugarcoating: avoiding difficult feedback to keep relationship comfortable"
    - "Monologue: manager talks for 45 minutes, employee just listens and signs"
    - "Copy-paste reviews: same language for different employees (shows low effort)"
    - "Rating-first: deciding rating before writing substance (backward reasoning)"
    - "No follow-up: goals set then never revisited until next annual review"
    - "Bureaucratic compliance: focus on completing form, not on conversation quality"
