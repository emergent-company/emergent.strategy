definition:
  purpose: |
    Without clear progression paths, top performers leave because they don't 
    see how to grow. Promotions feel arbitrary. Managers struggle to give 
    developmental direction. A career framework provides clarity and fairness.
    
  outcome: |
    Every role has clear levels with documented expectations. Employees 
    understand what's required to advance. Promotions are consistent and 
    defensible. Development conversations are grounded in clear criteria.

# PRACTITIONER SCENARIOS
# ============================================================
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-012-001
    name: "Creating First Career Ladder During Rapid Growth"
    practitioner: VP of Engineering at 45-person startup
    organization_context: |
      Series A startup that grew from 8 to 45 in 18 months. Engineering team 
      is 22 people—mix of early employees (some with inflated titles) and 
      recent hires (some with compressed titles). One engineer is "Principal" 
      because she was employee #3, another is "Software Engineer" despite 
      being more senior. No promotion criteria exist.
    situation: |
      Three engineers asked about promotion in the same week. One had been 
      promised "senior title next year" during hiring. Two felt stuck without 
      knowing what advancement looks like. Meanwhile, employee #3 ("Principal") 
      is resistant to any framework that might question her title.
    trigger: |
      Junior engineer asked: "What do I need to do to become a Senior Engineer?"
      VP realized she couldn't answer objectively. Title decisions were subjective.
    actions:
      - "Week 1: Researched industry frameworks (Progression.fyi, Dropbox, Buffer, GitLab public ladders)"
      - "Week 1: Interviewed 3 senior engineers: 'What does great look like at your level?'"
      - "Week 2: Drafted 4-level ladder (SE, SE2, Senior, Staff) with expectations per level"
      - "Week 2: Calibration session with engineering leads—mapped all 22 engineers to levels"
      - "Week 2: Identified 5 misaligned titles: 2 under-titled (immediate promotion), 3 over-titled (no change but expectations clarified)"
      - "Week 3: One-on-ones with misaligned individuals—explained new framework and their position"
      - "Week 3: Created compensation bands for each level with HR"
      - "Week 4: Published framework on internal wiki, presented at engineering all-hands"
      - "Week 4: Defined promotion process—manager nomination, calibration, approval cycle"
    outcome: |
      Framework established. Two under-titled engineers promoted immediately with 
      back-pay adjustment. Three over-titled employees had difficult but necessary 
      conversations—all stayed, one became a culture advocate for the new system. 
      Future promotions now reference framework. Principal Engineer (employee #3) 
      eventually embraced framework as it validated her seniority. Recruiting 
      became easier with clear leveling.
    lessons:
      - "Start simple—4-5 levels is enough for <50 engineers"
      - "Mapping existing team reveals misalignment that must be addressed"
      - "Over-titled individuals need careful handling—clarify expectations, not title"
      - "Published frameworks make recruiting conversations clearer"
      - "Framework doesn't solve politics, but makes discussions more objective"

  - id: ps-012-002
    name: "Adding Manager Track to IC-Only Ladder"
    practitioner: Director of People at 80-person tech company
    organization_context: |
      Series B company with established IC ladder (4 levels: SE, SE2, Senior, 
      Staff). No management track. Senior engineers are pressured into management 
      because it's the only "promotion" visible. Three recent manager transitions 
      failed—great engineers becoming struggling managers. Senior engineers want 
      advancement but not all want to manage.
    situation: |
      Top senior engineer says she'll leave if the only path forward is management. 
      She wants to grow technically but sees manager title as only recognition. 
      Meanwhile, accidental managers are drowning and their teams are suffering. 
      Need to create real alternative for technical excellence.
    trigger: |
      Senior engineer in 1:1: "I've been Senior for 2 years. If I can't become 
      Staff without managing, I need to find somewhere I can grow as an IC."
    actions:
      - "Month 1: Interviewed 5 senior ICs about what 'Staff' means to them"
      - "Month 1: Interviewed 3 struggling managers about why they became managers"
      - "Month 1: Researched dual-track models (Spotify, Etsy, Stripe)"
      - "Month 2: Drafted parallel manager track: Engineering Manager → Senior EM → Director"
      - "Month 2: Drafted IC track extension: Staff Engineer → Principal Engineer"
      - "Month 2: Key distinction: Managers grow people/teams, Staff/Principal grow technical leverage"
      - "Month 3: Defined switching criteria—when ICs can become managers and vice versa"
      - "Month 3: Recalibrated current managers and senior ICs against new framework"
      - "Month 3: One manager transitioned back to IC track (Staff) with full support"
      - "Month 4: Published dual-track framework, announced promotions of 2 to Staff"
    outcome: |
      Dual track successful. Senior engineer who threatened to leave became 
      first Staff promotion, stayed 3+ years. Accidental manager returned to 
      IC track and became top performer. Future manager selections improved—
      people opted in rather than defaulting. Both tracks compensated equally 
      (eliminating management premium). Engineering culture improved significantly.
    lessons:
      - "Management is a career change, not a promotion—should be opt-in"
      - "Equal compensation removes false incentive to become a manager"
      - "Switching between tracks should be possible (not a one-way door)"
      - "Staff/Principal roles need clear scope—company-wide impact, not just senior work"
      - "Accidental managers become great ICs when given off-ramp"

  - id: ps-012-003
    name: "Extending Framework to Non-Technical Functions"
    practitioner: Chief People Officer at 200-person B2B company
    organization_context: |
      Well-established engineering ladder (6 levels, dual-track). But sales, 
      marketing, customer success have no framework. Sales reps promoted 
      based on quota attainment only. Marketing has only 3 undefined levels. 
      CS reps feel stuck. Tension between "engineering gets everything" and 
      other functions.
    situation: |
      Head of Customer Success escalating: "My best CSM is leaving because 
      there's no path to Senior or Manager. Engineering has 6 levels, we have 
      2." Similar complaints from Sales and Marketing. CEO wants parity across 
      functions without creating bureaucracy.
    trigger: |
      CS team attrition hit 35% annual—exit interviews cited lack of growth path.
    actions:
      - "Month 1: Audited all functions—Engineering (6 levels), Sales (2), Marketing (3), CS (2), Ops (undefined)"
      - "Month 1: Benchmarked with 3 similar companies for non-technical frameworks"
      - "Month 2: Worked with each function head to draft 4-level frameworks"
      - "Month 2: Key principle: consistent structure (IC1 → IC2 → Senior → Principal), function-specific expectations"
      - "Month 2: Mapped all current employees to new levels—identified gaps and anomalies"
      - "Month 3: Calibration sessions per function—harder in sales where quota dominates thinking"
      - "Month 3: Created compensation bands aligned with engineering (same level = same range)"
      - "Month 3: Addressed 12 under-leveled employees with promotions, 8 over-leveled with clarified expectations"
      - "Month 4: Rolled out across company with function-specific all-hands"
      - "Month 6: First cross-function calibration—ensured 'Senior' means similar across company"
    outcome: |
      Unified framework across all functions. CS attrition dropped to 18% 
      within a year. Sales initially resistant but adopted after seeing 
      clarity it provided. Marketing embraced for recruiting advantage. 
      Cross-functional moves became easier with level equivalency. "Engineering 
      favoritism" perception eliminated. Took 18 months to fully mature across 
      all functions.
    lessons:
      - "Same structure, different expectations—levels should translate across functions"
      - "Quota attainment ≠ career progression—sales needs skill-based criteria too"
      - "Cross-function calibration prevents level inflation in any one function"
      - "Each function head must own their framework—HR facilitates, doesn't dictate"
      - "Rolling out takes time—don't rush, get each function right"

# ============================================================
# RISKS
# ============================================================
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: Framework becomes checkbox exercise
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Expectations should be outcomes-based not task lists, require demonstrated judgment not just activity, calibrate regularly"
    
    - risk: Levels inflate over time
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "External benchmarking annually, cross-team calibration, resist title pressure in hiring"
    
    - risk: Framework too complex to use
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Start simple (3-4 levels), add complexity only when needed, keep documentation concise"
    
    - risk: Promotion decisions still feel arbitrary
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Transparent calibration process, clear criteria with examples, manager training on evaluation"
    
    - risk: Framework doesn't fit all roles
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: "Group roles into families with shared structure, allow function-specific expectations, don't force-fit"
    
    - risk: Compensation misaligned with levels
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: "Build comp bands simultaneously with levels, market data per level, no level without band"

  organizational_risks:
    - risk: Management seen as only path
      impact: "ICs leave because management is the only visible advancement; company loses technical depth"
      prevention: "Create parallel IC and management tracks with equal compensation and recognition"
    
    - risk: Framework becomes political tool
      impact: "Levels used to justify decisions already made, not to guide development"
      prevention: "Calibration across managers, clear appeals process, connect to development not just evaluation"
    
    - risk: Over-titled employees cause friction
      impact: "Employees with inflated titles relative to new framework feel demoted; can trigger departures"
      prevention: "Grandfather existing titles or clarify expectations privately, no public demotions"

# ============================================================
# DOMAIN CONTEXT
# ============================================================
domain_context:
  industry_landscape: |
    Career frameworks have evolved from HR bureaucracy to competitive necessity. 
    Public frameworks from GitLab, Buffer, Artsy, and others have raised 
    transparency expectations. Candidates increasingly ask "what's your career 
    ladder?" during interviews. Glassdoor reviews mention "no growth path" as 
    top departure reason.
    
    The dual-track model (IC vs Manager) is now table stakes for tech companies 
    beyond 50 people. Companies like Spotify, Stripe, and Netflix have 
    sophisticated frameworks that clearly distinguish technical leadership 
    from people management. The myth that "management is a promotion" is 
    fading as companies realize it's a different skill set.
    
    Compensation transparency laws and pay equity requirements have made 
    explicit leveling essential. You can't have fair, defensible compensation 
    without clear levels. Career frameworks have become compliance infrastructure 
    as well as development tools.

  best_practices:
    - practice: "Dual-track IC/Manager paths"
      description: "Separate tracks for individual contributors and people managers with clear switching criteria"
      evidence: "Companies with dual tracks report 25% lower IC attrition and 30% better manager quality"
    
    - practice: "Expectations-based levels"
      description: "Levels defined by demonstrated behavior and impact, not tasks or tenure"
      evidence: "Expectations-based frameworks correlate with clearer development conversations"
    
    - practice: "Public frameworks"
      description: "Career ladder published internally (and sometimes externally) for transparency"
      evidence: "Public frameworks improve recruiting (candidates know what they're getting) and retention (employees see path)"
    
    - practice: "Regular calibration"
      description: "Cross-manager calibration to ensure consistent leveling across teams"
      evidence: "Calibration reduces level inflation and perceived unfairness"

  anti_patterns:
    - anti_pattern: "Levels as tenure reward"
      description: "Promoting based on time in role rather than demonstrated capability"
      consequence: "Level inflation, Peter Principle promotions, high performers leave"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Manager-only advancement"
      description: "Only path to higher compensation is management"
      consequence: "Accidental managers, lost technical depth, IC attrition"
    
    - anti_pattern: "Framework exists but isn't used"
      description: "Career ladder on wiki but promotions still arbitrary"
      consequence: "Cynicism about HR processes, worse than no framework"
    
    - anti_pattern: "One framework fits all"
      description: "Same expectations for all functions without adaptation"
      consequence: "Framework doesn't fit non-engineering roles, creates second-class citizens"

  benchmarks:
    - metric: "Level coverage"
      top_quartile: "100% of employees mapped to defined level with documented expectations"
      median: "Engineering has levels, other functions partial"

    - metric: "Promotion rate"
      top_quartile: "15-20% annual promotion rate with clear criteria justification"
      median: "10-15% annually"
      laggard: "<5% or >30% (too slow or too fast)"
    
    - metric: "Level consistency"
      top_quartile: "Cross-functional calibration, consistent meaning of 'Senior' company-wide"
      median: "Within-function calibration only"
      laggard: "No calibration, manager discretion only"
    
    - metric: "Dual-track balance"
      top_quartile: "40-50% of senior+ ICs choose IC track over management"
      median: "20-30% choose IC track"
      laggard: "No IC track, or IC track is 'second class'"
