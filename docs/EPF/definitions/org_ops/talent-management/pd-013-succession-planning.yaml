      - Document key knowledge and relationships
    effort: "Half day annually"

      - Multiple succession depth (n+1, n+2, n+3)
      - External candidate mapping
      - Board-level review
      - Retention risk monitoring
    effort: "Ongoing talent management function"

definition:
  purpose: |
    Key people leave, get sick, or take opportunities elsewhere. Without 
    succession planning, organizations scramble when critical roles become 
    vacant. Business continuity requires knowing who can step up.
    
  outcome: |
    Every critical role has identified successors. Successors are aware and 
    being developed. If someone leaves unexpectedly, there's a plan. 
    Leadership team feels confident about bench strength.
