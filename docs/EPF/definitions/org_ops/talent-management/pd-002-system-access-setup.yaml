definition:
  purpose: |
    New employees need access to various systems to do their work. Without a systematic 
    approach, access is often incomplete, delayed, or inconsistent - leading to 
    productivity loss and potential security gaps. This process ensures timely, complete, 
    and documented access provisioning.
    
  outcome: |
    New employee has verified working access to all role-appropriate systems. Access 
    is documented, follows least-privilege principles, and can be audited.

    - "License limits → Monitor seat counts, budget for growth"
    - "Vendor approval delays → Build buffer for third-party systems"
