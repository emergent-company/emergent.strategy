definition:
  purpose: |
    OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) translate strategy into measurable quarterly 
    goals. They answer: "What do we need to achieve?" (Objectives) and "How will we 
    know we achieved it?" (Key Results). Good KRs force clarity about what success 
    actually looks like, prevent wishful thinking, and enable honest progress conversations.
    
    Without clear Key Results, teams mistake activity for progress. Meetings happen, 
    features ship, campaigns run - but the company doesn't actually move toward its 
    strategic goals. OKRs create the bridge between "we want to be the market leader" 
    and "we will increase monthly active users from 10K to 50K."
    
  outcome: |
    Each quarter has 3-5 company-level Objectives with 2-4 measurable Key Results each.
    Teams understand how their work connects to company goals. Progress is visible and
    discussed regularly. At quarter end, there's honest assessment of what was achieved,
    and learnings feed into next quarter's planning.

    - step: 1
      action: Review previous quarter
      responsible: Leadership Team
      duration: "1-2 hours"
      deliverable: OKR retrospective summary
      includes:
        - Score each KR (0-1.0 scale or RAG)
        - Identify what enabled/blocked progress
        - Capture learnings and carry-overs
        - Note any strategic pivots needed
      
    - step: 2
      action: Confirm strategic priorities
      responsible: CEO
      duration: "1-2 hours"
      deliverable: Top 3-5 strategic themes for quarter
      includes:
        - What matters most this quarter?
        - What are we explicitly NOT doing?
        - Any major strategic shifts?
        - External factors to account for?
      
    - step: 3
      action: Draft company Objectives
      responsible: CEO with Leadership input
      duration: "2-3 hours"
      deliverable: Draft Objectives (3-5)
      criteria:
        - Qualitative and inspiring (the "what")
        - Achievable in one quarter
        - Directly advances strategy
        - Not a KR masquerading as an O
      examples:
        - "Establish product-market fit with SMB segment"
        - "Build the foundation for scalable growth"
        - "Become the trusted partner in our category"
      
    - step: 4
      action: Define Key Results for each Objective
      responsible: Leadership Team + functional leads
      duration: "3-4 hours (often over multiple sessions)"
      deliverable: Draft Key Results (2-4 per Objective)
      criteria:
        - Quantitative and measurable
        - Has a specific number and deadline
        - Outcome-focused, not task-focused
        - Answers "how will we know?"
        - Ambitious but not impossible
      format: |
        Each KR should follow pattern:
        "[Metric] from [current] to [target] by [date]"
        
        Good: "Increase MRR from $50K to $100K by end of Q2"
        Bad: "Launch new pricing page" (task, not outcome)
        Bad: "Improve customer satisfaction" (not measurable)
      
    - step: 5
      action: Reality-check and dependency-map
      responsible: Leadership Team
      duration: "1-2 hours"
      deliverable: Validated KRs with dependencies noted
      questions:
        - "Is this achievable with current resources?"
        - "What needs to be true for this to happen?"
        - "Which KRs depend on each other?"
        - "Are we spread too thin across too many KRs?"
        - "Is this a committed (must hit) or stretch (aspirational) KR?"
      
    - step: 6
      action: Cascade to teams (if applicable)
      responsible: Team leads
      duration: "Half-day per team"
      deliverable: Team OKRs aligned to company OKRs
      approach: |
        Each team asks: "What can we contribute to company KRs?"
        Team OKRs should be a subset, not separate goals.
        Cross-functional dependencies should be explicit.
        Avoid over-cascading - not every team needs formal OKRs.
      
    - step: 7
      action: Finalize and communicate
      responsible: CEO + Chief of Staff
      duration: "2-3 hours"
      deliverable: Final OKRs shared company-wide
      includes:
        - Written document/wiki page
        - All-hands presentation
        - Connection to "why" (strategy context)
        - How progress will be tracked
        
    - step: 8
      action: Establish tracking cadence
      responsible: OKR owner (often Chief of Staff or Ops)
      duration: "Setup: 1 hour, Ongoing: 1 hour/week"
      deliverable: Weekly/bi-weekly OKR updates
      format: |
        For each KR:
        - Current value vs target
        - On track / At risk / Off track
        - What's blocking progress?
        - What's needed to get back on track?
      
    - step: 9
      action: End-of-quarter scoring and retro
      responsible: Leadership Team
      duration: "2-3 hours"
      deliverable: Scored OKRs + retrospective
      includes:
        - Final score for each KR
        - What worked, what didn't
        - Learnings for next cycle
        - Input to next quarter planning

  cadence:
    frequency: quarterly
    trigger: End of previous quarter / beginning of new quarter
    duration: "Planning: 3-5 days, Tracking: ongoing"

      - Week before Q end: Review current quarter, start next Q planning
      - First week of Q: Finalize and communicate OKRs
      - Weeks 2-11: Track progress, adjust as needed
      - Week 12: Begin retrospective and next cycle planning

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "First OKR cycle at a 12-person startup"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: "12-person seed-stage startup, never done formal OKRs, growing from 'everyone knows what to do' to 'we need coordination'"
    situation: |
      Sarah (CEO) notices that as the team grew from 5 to 12, alignment became harder. 
      Different people have different ideas of what success looks like. In team meetings, 
      everyone is busy but Sarah isn't sure they're working on the right things. An 
      advisor suggested OKRs but Sarah has heard horror stories of OKR bureaucracy 
      killing startup velocity. She wants the benefits without the overhead.
    trigger: "Team is working hard but feels scattered; advisor recommends trying OKRs"
    actions: |
      1. Sarah reads "Measure What Matters" and some blog posts but finds them too 
         corporate. Decides to start minimal: company-level OKRs only, no cascading.
      2. Does solo brainstorm: what are the 3 things that matter most this quarter?
         Comes up with 5 - forces herself to cut to 3.
      3. For each Objective, asks: "If we achieved this, what would be different? 
         What would we see?" Writes 2-3 Key Results per Objective.
      4. Shares draft with co-founder and head of product for gut-check. They push 
         back on one KR being unrealistic, adjust target.
      5. Presents to team at Monday all-hands: "Here's what winning looks like this 
         quarter." Explains the "why" behind each Objective.
      6. Sets up simple Notion table: Objective | Key Result | Current | Target | 
         Status. Updates weekly before all-hands.
      7. At end of quarter, scores each KR honestly. Achieved 6/9 KRs (67%). 
         Discusses why 3 were missed - one was genuinely too ambitious, two had 
         unforeseen blockers.
      8. Key learning: some KRs were actually tasks ("launch X"). Rewrites as 
         outcomes for next quarter.
    outcome: |
      Team felt more aligned. Weekly updates created healthy accountability without 
      micro-management. The failed KRs generated useful strategic discussions. 
      Next quarter, OKRs were sharper because the team understood the format better. 
      Sarah didn't cascade to teams - at 12 people, company OKRs were enough.
    lessons:
      - "Start minimal - company OKRs only, 3 Objectives max"
      - "First cycle is about learning the format, not perfect execution"
      - "Weekly visibility matters more than sophisticated tooling"
      - "It's okay to miss some KRs - it means you were ambitious"
      - "Outcome-focused KRs take practice; task-based KRs sneak in"
      - "Don't over-cascade at small scale - it creates overhead without value"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Recovering from OKR failure at 80-person scaleup"
    practitioner: "VP of Operations / Chief of Staff"
    organization_context: "80-person Series B, tried OKRs twice before and failed, team is skeptical, leadership wants to try again 'right'"
    situation: |
      Marcus (VP Ops) is asked to "make OKRs work this time." Previous attempts failed: 
      first time, OKRs were set and forgotten. Second time, there were so many OKRs 
      that tracking was overwhelming. The team is cynical - they see OKRs as another 
      management fad. Marcus needs to rebuild trust while actually getting value from 
      the framework.
    trigger: "CEO wants one more attempt at OKRs; Marcus is accountable for making it work"
    actions: |
      1. Marcus interviews team leads: "What went wrong before?" Patterns emerge:
         - Too many OKRs (25+ KRs company-wide)
         - No tracking cadence - set and forget
         - KRs were tasks, not outcomes
         - No connection between team work and company goals
      2. Proposes constraints for new approach:
         - Max 5 Objectives, max 3 KRs per Objective (15 KRs total)
         - Bi-weekly OKR reviews in leadership meeting (non-negotiable)
         - Only 2 levels: company and team (no individual OKRs)
         - KRs must have numbers and dates
      3. Runs planning session differently: starts with "What does winning look like 
         in December?" instead of "What do we want to do?" Forces outcome thinking.
      4. For each proposed KR, asks: "Do we have data to measure this?" If no, either 
         change the KR or commit to instrumenting the metric first.
      5. Introduces committed vs aspirational distinction: 8 KRs are committed (must 
         hit), 7 are stretch (50% chance of hitting).
      6. Creates Slack channel #okr-updates. Every Monday, each KR owner posts 
         traffic light + one sentence. Takes 5 minutes per person.
      7. First bi-weekly review: 4 KRs already at risk. Has honest conversation about 
         why and what to do. Team sees that tracking is leading to action, not blame.
      8. End of quarter: 11/15 KRs achieved (73%). More importantly, the 4 misses 
         were all surfaced early and discussed. No surprises.
    outcome: |
      Team attitude shifted from cynical to cautiously positive. The cadence and 
      simplicity made the difference. Marcus's post-mortem: previous failures were 
      about over-engineering (too many OKRs) and under-operating (no tracking). 
      This time, fewer OKRs + consistent tracking = actual utility.
    lessons:
      - "Diagnose why previous attempts failed before trying again"
      - "Fewer OKRs with real tracking beats many OKRs with none"
      - "Committed vs aspirational distinction prevents gaming/sandbagging"
      - "Weekly async updates + bi-weekly discussions is sustainable cadence"
      - "Surfacing 'at risk' early builds trust in the system"
      - "OKR success is as much about operating rhythm as goal quality"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Cascading OKRs in a 200-person company"
    practitioner: "Director of Strategy"
    organization_context: "200-person Series C, company OKRs exist but teams feel disconnected from them, needs cascade without bureaucracy"
    situation: |
      Chen (Director of Strategy) has a problem: company OKRs are set quarterly by 
      the exec team, but team leads don't know how their work connects. Engineering 
      has their own roadmap, Sales has their targets, Marketing has their campaigns - 
      none explicitly linked to company OKRs. It feels like two parallel systems. 
      Chen is asked to "cascade OKRs" but has seen that go badly (200 OKRs, no one 
      can keep track).
    trigger: "Exec team frustrated that company OKRs feel disconnected from team execution"
    actions: |
      1. Chen maps current state: 5 company Objectives, 14 Key Results. But only 
         40% of team work can be traced to any company KR. The rest is "keep the 
         lights on" or "stuff we've always done."
      2. Instead of forcing every team to have OKRs, asks: "Which teams are directly 
         responsible for company KRs?" Identifies 8 teams (of 15) that own pieces 
         of company KRs.
      3. For each company KR, creates "KR owner" role. This person (often a team 
         lead) is responsible for progress, even if work spans multiple teams.
      4. Each KR owner creates 2-3 team-level KRs that contribute to their company 
         KR. These are commitments: "If we hit these, we'll hit the company KR."
      5. For teams NOT owning company KRs (e.g., IT, Legal), doesn't force OKRs. 
         They have service-level commitments instead. "Not every team needs OKRs."
      6. Creates dependency map: which team KRs depend on other teams? Surfaces 
         3 major dependencies that weren't explicit before.
      7. Monthly cross-functional OKR review: KR owners present progress, surface 
         blockers, ask for help. Exec team removes obstacles.
      8. End of quarter: 11/14 company KRs achieved. Importantly, teams now see 
         the connection between their work and company goals.
    outcome: |
      Cascade worked because it was selective, not comprehensive. Key insight: OKRs 
      are for strategic priorities, not operational work. Not every team needs them. 
      The "KR owner" model created accountability without creating 200 OKRs. 
      Dependencies became visible, reducing surprise blockers.
    lessons:
      - "Not every team needs OKRs - cascade selectively"
      - "KR owner model creates accountability across team boundaries"
      - "Dependency mapping is as valuable as the OKRs themselves"
      - "Operational teams can use SLAs instead of OKRs"
      - "Monthly cross-functional reviews surface blockers early"
      - "40-60% of work won't map to OKRs - that's normal"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "OKRs set but not tracked - become shelf-ware"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Assign explicit OKR owner responsible for tracking cadence. Add OKR review 
        to existing meeting (don't create new meeting). Start with weekly async 
        updates, move to bi-weekly reviews. Make OKRs visible in team communication.
        
    - risk: "Too many OKRs - creates overwhelm and dilution"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Set hard limits: max 5 Objectives, max 3-4 KRs per Objective at company 
        level. If team wants more, they're not prioritizing. "If everything is a 
        priority, nothing is." Push back on scope creep.
        
    - risk: "KRs are tasks, not outcomes - misses the point"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Test each KR: "Can I measure this without doing the work?" If no, it's a 
        task. Rephrase as outcomes. "Launch feature X" → "Users adopt feature X 
        (measure: weekly active users of X)". Train on the difference.
        
    - risk: "Sandbagging - teams set easy KRs to guarantee hitting them"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Use committed vs aspirational distinction. Committed KRs should be 
        aggressive but achievable. Aspirational KRs should be moonshots. 
        70-80% achievement is healthy. 100% means you aimed too low.
        
    - risk: "Gaming metrics - Goodhart's Law in action"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Pair quantity metrics with quality metrics (e.g., "increase signups" + 
        "maintain activation rate"). Watch for unintended consequences. Be 
        willing to change KRs mid-quarter if gaming emerges.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "OKRs become bureaucratic overhead instead of useful alignment"
      impact: |
        Team spends more time on OKR process than on actual work. Cynicism grows.
        OKRs are seen as management theater, not useful tool. Best people resist
        participating. System collapses after 2-3 cycles.
      prevention: |
        Start minimal (Tier 1). Add complexity only when there's clear need.
        Regularly ask: "Is this process worth the time?" Be willing to simplify.
        Kill rituals that don't add value. The goal is alignment, not process.
        
    - risk: "OKRs disconnect from actual strategy"
      impact: |
        Team hits OKRs but doesn't advance strategically. Celebrating wins that
        don't matter. False confidence. Strategic drift masked by tactical success.
      prevention: |
        Start OKR planning from strategy, not from current work. Ask "What must
        be true for our strategy to succeed?" before writing OKRs. Regularly
        reconnect OKRs to North Star. If an OKR doesn't advance strategy, why is
        it an OKR?
        
    - risk: "OKRs create silos - teams optimize their OKRs at expense of company"
      impact: |
        Local optimization beats global optimization. Teams compete instead of 
        collaborate. Handoffs fail. Customer experience suffers even as team 
        metrics improve.
      prevention: |
        Include cross-functional KRs. Map dependencies explicitly. Review at 
        company level, not just team level. Celebrate collaborative wins. 
        CEOs should own company KRs, not just aggregate team KRs.
