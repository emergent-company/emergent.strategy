definition:
  purpose: |
    Competitive benchmarking answers: "How do we compare to alternatives?" This 
    isn't about copying competitors - it's about understanding the landscape so 
    you can position and differentiate effectively.
    
    What competitive benchmarking reveals:
    - Where you're ahead (leverage in positioning and sales)
    - Where you're behind (roadmap priorities or defensive messaging)
    - Where the market is heading (trends across competitors)
    - How customers perceive options (not just what vendors claim)
    
    Warning signs of weak competitive intelligence:
    - Sales loses deals without knowing why
    - Can't articulate why customers should choose you
    - Surprised by competitor announcements
    - Positioning is reactive, not proactive
    
    This is NOT about obsessing over competitors. Spend 90% of energy on 
    customers, 10% on competition. But that 10% matters.
    
  outcome: |
    Competitive intelligence that:
    - Enables sharp positioning and differentiation
    - Arms sales with win tactics
    - Informs product roadmap prioritization
    - Reduces competitive surprise

        - "Who could become a competitor (adjacent players)?"
      tiering:
        - "Tier 1 (3-5): Primary competitors. Frequent in deals, direct overlap."
        - "Tier 2 (5-10): Secondary. Occasional overlap, different positioning."
        - "Tier 3: Watch list. Adjacent players, potential threats."
      avoid:
        - "Listing every tangential player (focus on real competition)"
        - "Ignoring 'do nothing' as a competitor (it's often the biggest one)"

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Sales losing deals and not knowing why"
    practitioner: "Product Marketing Manager"
    organization_context: "40-person Series A B2B SaaS, no formal competitive intelligence, sales frustrated"
    situation: |
      Mia (first Product Marketing hire) joins and immediately hears from sales: 
      "We keep losing to [Competitor X] and don't know why." When she asks 
      sales what they know about Competitor X, she gets vague answers: "They're 
      cheaper" or "They have more features." Nobody has actually analyzed the 
      competitor, talked to customers who chose them, or built positioning 
      against them. Sales is guessing.
    trigger: "CEO asks 'Why did we lose that $200K deal to Competitor X?' and nobody can answer"
    actions: |
      1. Mia decides to build competitive intelligence from scratch. Starts 
         with Competitor X since they're the most painful.
      2. Signs up for Competitor X trial, watches all their demos, reads all 
         their content. Notes: positioning, features, pricing, customer stories.
      3. Reads 50 reviews of Competitor X on G2. Patterns: "Easy to use" but 
         "limited customization." Strong on SMB, weak on enterprise.
      4. Asks sales for 5 lost deals against Competitor X. Interviews 3 
         customers (others won't talk). Learns: "They were 30% cheaper and 
         we didn't need the advanced features you have."
      5. Builds competitor profile: Competitor X targets SMB with easy setup 
         and low price. Weak on enterprise scale and customization.
      6. Creates battlecard: "When competing with X, focus on enterprise 
         requirements they can't meet. Don't compete on price for SMB deals."
      7. Trains sales: Live session walking through battlecard. Role-plays 
         competitive scenarios. Sales finally has language and tactics.
      8. Over 3 months: Win rate against Competitor X improves from 30% to 
         50%. More importantly, sales qualifies out bad-fit SMB deals earlier, 
         reducing wasted time.
    outcome: |
      Win rate vs. Competitor X improved from 30% to 50%. Sales has language 
      and tactics. More importantly, they now qualify out deals that are 
      better fit for competitor. Key learning: most competitive losses aren't 
      about product - they're about fit and positioning.
    lessons:
      - "Most sales doesn't understand competitors - they're guessing"
      - "Win/loss interviews reveal the real reasons you lose"
      - "Sometimes best tactic is to qualify OUT bad-fit deals"
      - "Reviews are goldmine - customers are honest"
      - "Live training > sharing docs - role-play matters"
      - "Focus on one competitor at a time, do it well"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "New competitor entering market aggressively"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: "80-person Series B, well-funded new entrant disrupting pricing, creating panic"
    situation: |
      David (CEO) learns a new competitor launched last month with $30M in 
      funding and aggressive pricing (50% below market). They're getting 
      press coverage and poaching his customers. The board asks "What's your 
      response?" Sales is panicking. Product wants to cut prices immediately.
      David needs to understand the threat and develop a response.
    trigger: "Lost 3 customers to new entrant in one month; board asking for response plan"
    actions: |
      1. David resists knee-jerk reactions. "Let's understand before we respond."
         Blocks 48 hours for deep competitive analysis.
      2. Researches new entrant: product (signs up for trial), team (LinkedIn), 
         funding (Crunchbase), positioning (website, press). Notes: backed by 
         strong investors, team from competitor, positioning on price.
      3. Talks to 2 churned customers: "Why did you switch?" Answers: 
         "They're cheaper and we didn't use your advanced features." Pattern: 
         low-usage customers attracted to price.
      4. Analyzes own customer base: Which customers are at risk? Low-usage, 
         price-sensitive, not using differentiated features. Which are safe? 
         High-usage, enterprise, dependent on integrations.
      5. Develops response strategy:
         - Don't compete on price (race to bottom, they have $30M)
         - Double down on differentiation (enterprise, scale, integrations)
         - Proactively reach out to at-risk customers (retention > new)
         - Build competitive positioning: "Great for simple use cases, 
           we're for companies that need [X, Y, Z]"
      6. Creates internal narrative: "This competitor is good for the market. 
         They'll grow the pie. We're positioned for the top end." Calms 
         panic, focuses team.
      7. Three months later: Competitor took some low-end customers (expected) 
         but David's company retained enterprise base and grew in target segment.
    outcome: |
      Avoided panic reaction. Retained enterprise base while accepting 
      lower-end churn. Competitor got some market share but also grew 
      awareness for the category. Key learning: not every competitor is 
      a threat - some segment the market in your favor.
    lessons:
      - "Don't panic when new competitor launches - analyze first"
      - "Understand WHO is at risk, not just that you're losing"
      - "Sometimes losing some customers is the right strategy"
      - "Competing on price with funded competitor is losing game"
      - "Double down on differentiation, don't try to be everything"
      - "Internal narrative matters - calm the team with strategy"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Incumbent waking up and fighting back"
    practitioner: "VP Product"
    organization_context: "120-person Series C, large incumbent just announced competitive features"
    situation: |
      Aisha (VP Product) built her product to disrupt a large incumbent. For 
      2 years, the incumbent ignored them. But now the incumbent announced 
      they're launching a competitive product with similar features. The 
      incumbent has 10x the resources, existing customer relationships, and 
      brand recognition. The board is worried. Customers are asking "Should 
      we wait for [Incumbent]?"
    trigger: "Incumbent announces competing product; customers asking 'should we wait for them?'"
    actions: |
      1. Aisha runs a "competitive war room" to develop response. Includes 
         product, marketing, sales leaders.
      2. Analyzes incumbent announcement: What did they actually say? Often 
         announcements are vaporware. Digs in: no launch date, limited details, 
         sounds like early development.
      3. Creates timeline analysis: If they announced today, when can they 
         ship a mature product? Based on their history: 12-18 months. Aisha 
         has 12-18 month head start on execution.
      4. Identifies structural advantages: Startup can move faster, isn't 
         constrained by legacy, has focused team. Incumbent has legacy 
         architecture, divided attention, political overhead.
      5. Develops competitive positioning: "They're bolting on what we were 
         built for. We're purpose-built. They're compromised by legacy."
      6. Creates customer response guide for sales: When customer says "Should 
         we wait for [Incumbent]?" Answer: "When do you need to solve this? 
         They haven't shipped yet. We have 500 customers live today."
      7. Doubles down on innovation: Uses head start to accelerate roadmap. 
         Ships 3 major features in 6 months while incumbent is still announcing.
      8. One year later: Incumbent shipped a basic product that doesn't compete 
         on depth. Aisha's company continued to win on differentiation.
    outcome: |
      Incumbent's competitive product was late and shallow. Aisha's company 
      maintained market position by out-executing. Key learning: announcements 
      ≠ products, and startups can outrun incumbents if they stay focused.
    lessons:
      - "Announcements are not products - dig into what was actually said"
      - "Incumbents move slowly - use your speed advantage"
      - "Purpose-built beats bolt-on in most competitive battles"
      - "Arm sales with responses to 'should we wait?' questions"
      - "Use competitive pressure to accelerate your roadmap"
      - "Customer relationships and execution > resource size"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Competitor obsession"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Keep competitive intelligence in perspective. 90% focus on customers, 
        10% on competitors. Don't let competitive fear drive roadmap - customer 
        needs should drive roadmap.
        
    - risk: "Intelligence becomes stale"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Set regular update cadence (quarterly minimum). Monitor news feeds 
        weekly. Win/loss interviews keep insights fresh. Date-stamp all 
        information so users know how current it is.
        
    - risk: "Sales doesn't use battlecards"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Train in person, not just sharing docs. Role-play scenarios. Make 
        battlecards easily accessible (in CRM, Slack). Keep them short and 
        actionable. Get sales feedback on what's useful.
        
    - risk: "Underestimating competitors"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Use objective data (reviews, win/loss) not just internal opinion.
        Acknowledge where competitors are strong. Don't dismiss 
        announcements - track them to reality.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Fear-driven decisions"
      impact: |
        Competitive moves trigger panic. Roadmap becomes reactive. Pricing 
        gets slashed. Team loses confidence. Strategy becomes incoherent.
      prevention: |
        Build analytical capability to assess threats objectively. Have 
        framework for competitive response (analyze, then respond). CEO 
        sets calm tone. Not every competitor is an existential threat.
        
    - risk: "Copying instead of differentiating"
      impact: |
        Roadmap chases competitor features. Lose focus on unique value.
        Always behind. Customers can't tell you apart.
      prevention: |
        Competitive intelligence informs roadmap, doesn't dictate it. Every 
        feature request should be validated with customers, not just matched 
        to competitors. Ask "Is this what OUR customers need?"
