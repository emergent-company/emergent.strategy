  purpose: |
    Every touchpoint with your brand creates an impression. Visual inconsistency 
    signals organizational chaos to customers, partners, and prospects. It makes 
    a growing company look amateur while competitors with inferior products 
    appear more professional.
    
    Visual guidelines ensure that everyone—founders, marketers, contractors, 
    partners—represents the brand consistently. Not to stifle creativity, but 
    to create a foundation that makes creativity easier. When the rules are 
    clear, people spend less time debating colors and more time on the message.
    
    For startups, this doesn't mean a 100-page brand book. It means documenting 
    the essential decisions: What are our colors? What fonts do we use? How does 
    our logo work on different backgrounds? Most early-stage companies have 
    these answers in someone's head—the job is to get them documented so everyone 
    can execute consistently.
    
    The cost of not having visual guidelines compounds. Every inconsistent 
    touchpoint undermines brand equity you're trying to build. Every "let me 
    ask the founder what color to use" slows execution. Every contractor who 
    invents new visual elements creates confusion.
    
  outcome: |
    Anyone creating brand materials can execute consistently without asking 
    questions. Materials look professionally cohesive. Brand equity builds 
    instead of fragmenting. Design reviews focus on content, not visual debates.

  steps:
    - step: 1
      action: "Audit existing visual assets and usage"
      responsible: Marketing Lead / Designer
      duration: "2-4 hours"
      deliverable: "Current state inventory"
      templates:
        - "Brand asset audit checklist"
        - "Touchpoint inventory (where brand appears)"
      best_practices:
        - Screenshot every touchpoint—website, social, pitch decks, emails
        - Note inconsistencies but don't judge—just document
        - Include partner and third-party uses of your brand
      avoid:
        - Skipping this step—inconsistencies reveal what guidelines must address
        - Only auditing marketing materials (product, sales, support all use brand)
        
    - step: 2
      action: "Document logo usage rules"
      responsible: Designer / Brand Lead
      duration: "2-4 hours"
      deliverable: "Logo guidelines section"
      templates:
        - "Logo anatomy diagram"
        - "Clear space and minimum size specifications"
        - "Approved and prohibited usage examples"
      best_practices:
        - Show examples of correct and incorrect usage
        - Provide files in every format people need (SVG, PNG, EPS)
        - Include light/dark background versions
        - Define when to use wordmark vs. icon vs. full logo
      avoid:
        - Rules so restrictive nobody can use the logo
        - Missing common scenarios (email signatures, social avatars)
        
    - step: 3
      action: "Define and document color palette"
      responsible: Designer / Brand Lead
      duration: "1-2 hours"
      deliverable: "Color guidelines section"
      templates:
        - "Primary and secondary color swatches"
        - "Color usage ratios (60/30/10 rule)"
        - "Accessibility contrast checker results"
      best_practices:
        - Include all color formats (HEX, RGB, CMYK, Pantone for print)
        - Define primary color usage (dominant brand expression)
        - Define secondary colors (accents, supporting elements)
        - Check accessibility—many color combinations fail WCAG
      avoid:
        - Too many colors (3-5 is usually plenty)
        - Colors that only work on screens (need print equivalents)
        
    - step: 4
      action: "Establish typography system"
      responsible: Designer / Brand Lead
      duration: "1-2 hours"
      deliverable: "Typography guidelines section"
      templates:
        - "Font family specifications"
        - "Type scale (sizes and weights)"
        - "Pairing rules (which fonts go where)"
      best_practices:
        - Limit to 2-3 fonts (heading, body, accent if needed)
        - Include font licensing information
        - Provide fallback fonts for web/email
        - Define hierarchy (H1, H2, body, captions)
      avoid:
        - Fonts that require expensive licensing
        - System fonts for brand materials (look generic)
        - Too many weights and styles (creates visual chaos)
        
    - step: 5
      action: "Create visual do's and don'ts"
      responsible: Designer
      duration: "2-3 hours"
      deliverable: "Usage examples section"
      templates:
        - "Side-by-side comparison layouts"
        - "Common mistake gallery"
      best_practices:
        - Show real examples of correct and incorrect usage
        - Focus on the mistakes people actually make
        - Explain why something is wrong, not just that it is
        - Keep updating as new mistakes appear
      avoid:
        - Only abstract rules—show concrete examples
        - Overwhelming with edge cases (cover the 80% use cases)
        
    - step: 6
      action: "Create templates for common materials"
      responsible: Designer
      duration: "4-8 hours"
      deliverable: "Template library"
      templates:
        - "Presentation template (Google Slides/PPT)"
        - "Document template (Google Docs/Word)"
        - "Social media templates (sized correctly per platform)"
        - "Email signature template"
      best_practices:
        - Templates should be immediately usable, not just examples
        - Include instructions within templates
        - Host in shared location everyone can access
        - Update templates when brand evolves
      avoid:
        - Templates that require design software to edit
        - Locked templates that frustrate users (they'll work around them)
        
    - step: 7
      action: "Distribute and train"
      responsible: Marketing Lead
      duration: "1-2 hours"
      deliverable: "Team enabled on visual guidelines"
      templates:
        - "Brand guidelines walkthrough deck"
        - "Self-service FAQ"
      best_practices:
        - Make guidelines findable (link from internal wiki, shared drive)
        - Create a "quick start" version for common needs
        - Establish who to ask when guidelines don't cover a situation
        - Review with key stakeholders before announcing
      avoid:
        - Document dump without context
        - Making guidelines hard to find or access

  cadence:
    frequency: "Review quarterly, refresh annually, major update at rebrands"
    triggers:
      - New product line or major feature requiring visual treatment
      - Entering new market with different visual conventions
      - Consistent brand inconsistencies appearing despite guidelines
      - Designer turnover (ensure knowledge transfer)
    ongoing:
      - Review new materials for guideline compliance (spot checks)
      - Collect requests for additions/clarifications
      - Update templates when guidelines evolve
      - Maintain asset library organization

practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Building Visual Guidelines from Scratch for a Growing Startup"
    practitioner: "Head of Marketing"
    organization_context: |
      25-person B2B SaaS startup that's raised Series A. Brand was created 
      by founder with a freelance designer 2 years ago. No documented guidelines. 
      Marketing team of 3 plus regular contractors creating content.
    situation: |
      Every new hire asks "what color blue do we use?" Every contractor delivers 
      materials in different visual styles. CEO is frustrated that investor 
      deck, website, and product look like they're from different companies. 
      Team wastes hours debating visual decisions that should be obvious.
    trigger: |
      New marketing hire asked for brand guidelines on day one. Realization 
      that nothing exists except logo files in a Dropbox folder with five 
      different versions, some from 2018.
    actions: |
      Started with a "30-minute brand audit" by screenshotting every customer 
      touchpoint from website to email signatures to product UI to social, 
      finding 4 different blues, 3 different fonts, and 2 versions of logo 
      in active use. Scheduled 1-hour session with CEO to make decisions and 
      picked THE blue (from the logo), THE fonts (already in website CSS), 
      and THE rules for logo usage, writing decisions down immediately. Created 
      simple 8-page Google Slides deck covering logo (2 pages), colors (1 page), 
      typography (1 page), do's and don'ts (2 pages), where to get assets 
      (1 page), and who to ask questions (1 page). Built a shared folder with 
      organized assets including logo/light-backgrounds/, logo/dark-backgrounds/, 
      templates/, and fonts/, killing all other logo locations. Spent 4 hours 
      making templates people actually need: pitch deck, one-pager, social 
      graphics, and email signature—all editable in Google Slides/Docs, not 
      Adobe files. Sent guidelines to team with 5-minute walkthrough video and 
      set calendar reminder to review in 30 days.
    outcome: |
      Questions about colors and fonts dropped by 90% within a month. New 
      contractors can self-serve without onboarding calls. Materials started 
      looking consistent—CEO stopped complaining about the investor deck. 
      Added photography guidelines after 30 days when that became the next 
      common question. Total time investment: about 12 hours over 2 weeks.
    lessons:
      - Start with a minimal guidelines doc that covers the 80% case
      - Kill multiple versions of assets—confusion comes from too many options
      - Templates are more valuable than rules—make it easy to do right
      - Guidelines are living documents—add to them as questions arise

    name: "Migrating Visual Guidelines During a Brand Refresh"
    practitioner: "Brand Manager"
    organization_context: |
      80-person B2B company doing a brand refresh as part of repositioning. 
      Existing guidelines exist but are outdated. Need to transition entire 
      organization to new visual identity without chaos.
    situation: |
      Company is refreshing brand identity with new agency. New logo, colors, 
      and typography coming. Old brand is deeply embedded—thousands of assets, 
      partner materials, product UI, documentation. Need to manage transition 
      without creating Frankenstein brand during migration.
    trigger: |
      Board approved brand refresh budget. Agency delivered new identity system. 
      Now need to roll it out across the organization while business continues 
      operating.
    actions: |
      Created migration strategy before announcing anything by prioritizing 
      touchpoints by visibility and ease of change—customer-facing high-visibility 
      first, internal low-visibility last. Built comprehensive new guidelines 
      BEFORE any migration, working with agency to document everything thoroughly. 
      Created a "transition guidance" document alongside new guidelines covering 
      what to do when old and new appear together, when old is acceptable during 
      transition, and hard deadline after which old is forbidden. Executed phased 
      rollout over 6 weeks: Week 1-2 for website and product, Week 3-4 for 
      marketing materials and sales assets, Week 5-6 for internal and partner 
      materials, Week 7+ for catching stragglers. Set up brand asset management 
      system (Brandfolder) for single source of truth, removed old assets from 
      all shared locations, and made old brand literally inaccessible. Created 
      "brand police" checklist for launch and monitored all customer touchpoints 
      daily for first month. Held weekly office hours during transition to 
      answer questions and update guidelines with clarifications.
    outcome: |
      Completed migration in 8 weeks with minimal Frankenstein moments. 
      Customer-facing materials were 95% consistent within first month. 
      Partner materials took longer (expected). Internal documentation last 
      priority, still finding old logos months later but no customer impact. 
      New guidelines are 3x more comprehensive than old ones.
    lessons:
      - Migration plan is as important as the new guidelines themselves
      - Remove access to old assets—people will use what's easiest to find
      - Transition periods need explicit rules, not just "use new brand"
      - Weekly office hours during transition save dozens of async questions

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Enforcing Visual Guidelines with External Partners and Agencies"
    practitioner: "Marketing Director"
    organization_context: |
      50-person B2B company working with 5+ external agencies and partners 
      who create co-branded materials. Good internal brand compliance but 
      partners consistently misuse brand assets.
    situation: |
      Partners and agencies receive brand guidelines but materials come back 
      off-brand. Wrong logos, wrong colors, weird typography. Marketing team 
      spends hours fixing partner materials. Some partner materials go live 
      without review and embarrass the brand.
    trigger: |
      Major partner launched co-branded campaign with wrong logo version and 
      colors that weren't even in the palette. CEO saw it and demanded that 
      this never happens again.
    actions: |
      Diagnosed the problem: partners had guidelines but didn't read them, 
      used old assets found on Google, and there was no approval process 
      before materials went live. Created a partner-specific "quick start" 
      guide of 2 pages covering absolute essentials including common mistakes 
      with big red X marks. Built a partner portal with correct assets only 
      organized by use case ("need logo for light background?"), with downloads 
      tracked. Established mandatory brand review for co-branded materials 
      with no materials going live without marketing approval, built into 
      partner agreements going forward. Created a brand review SLA with 48-hour 
      turnaround for standard materials and 2-week advance notice for campaigns. 
      Launched quarterly partner brand training webinar of 30 minutes covering 
      common mistakes and taking questions, recorded for onboarding new partners. 
      Added positive reinforcement by highlighting great partner brand usage 
      and making compliant partners feel good about getting it right.
    outcome: |
      Brand violations from partners dropped by 80% in first quarter. Partner 
      portal gets 200+ asset downloads per month—self-service working. Review 
      process catches remaining issues before they go live. Some partners 
      initially pushed back on review requirement but accepted once they saw 
      how fast it was. No more CEO fire drills about partner brand misuse.
    lessons:
      - Partners need simpler guidelines than internal teams
      - Make correct assets the path of least resistance
      - Approval gates before public launch are non-negotiable
      - Investing in partner success pays off—train them, don't just police them

risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Guidelines too restrictive, creativity suffers"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Balance consistency with flexibility. Define what MUST be consistent 
        (logo, core colors) and what CAN vary (secondary colors, photography). 
        Include section on "creative interpretation within guidelines." Review 
        with creative team before finalizing—they'll spot overly restrictive rules.
        
    - risk: "Guidelines ignored because they're hard to find or use"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Single, obvious location for guidelines. Link from everywhere relevant 
        (onboarding docs, contractor briefs, agency kickoffs). Quick-start 
        version for common needs. Templates that make compliance easier than 
        non-compliance.
        
    - risk: "Assets scattered across multiple locations"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Single source of truth for all brand assets. Actively remove old 
        versions from other locations. Regular audits of shared drives and 
        cloud storage. Make the correct location the most convenient one.
        
    - risk: "Guidelines become outdated as brand evolves"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Quarterly reviews of guideline usage and questions. Process for adding 
        new guidance when new situations arise. Version numbering on guidelines. 
        "Last updated" date visible on all documents.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "No one owns guidelines maintenance"
      impact: |
        Guidelines decay as brand evolves. Different people make conflicting 
        decisions. Eventually guidelines become irrelevant and ignored. 
        Investment in creating them is wasted.
      prevention: |
        Assign clear ownership—one person is accountable for guidelines. 
        Include guidelines maintenance in job description and goals. Regular 
        review cadence on calendar, not ad hoc. Budget for updates and 
        improvements.
        
    - risk: "Brand consistency valued over brand effectiveness"
      impact: |
        Every material looks the same but none are optimized for their 
        purpose. Guidelines become excuse to reject creative ideas. Brand 
        feels stale and corporate rather than distinctive.
      prevention: |
        Guidelines should enable, not just restrict. Include examples of 
        creative applications within guidelines. Review guidelines for 
        unnecessarily restrictive rules. Celebrate great creative work 
        that follows guidelines, not just compliance.
