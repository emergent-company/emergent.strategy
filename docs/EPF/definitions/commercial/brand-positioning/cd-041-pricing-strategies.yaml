definition:
  purpose: |
    Pricing is the most powerful lever you have—and the most underutilized. 
    A 1% improvement in price realization typically has more profit impact 
    than 1% improvements in volume, cost, or churn. Yet most companies set 
    prices once and rarely optimize.
    
    Pricing strategy goes beyond "what should we charge." It encompasses: 
    How should we package value? What pricing model fits our business 
    (subscription, usage, tiered)? How do we price for different segments? 
    When and how do we raise prices? How do we handle discounting?
    
    The foundation is understanding value delivered. Customers don't buy 
    features—they buy outcomes. Price should reflect the value of those 
    outcomes, not your costs or competitor prices. Cost-plus and competitive 
    pricing leave money on the table if you deliver more value than cost 
    or competition suggests.
    
    For early-stage companies, pricing is a hypothesis that needs testing. 
    Start with a reasonable price, observe reactions, and iterate. Under-
    pricing is more common than overpricing—founders are often too afraid 
    to charge what value justifies.
    
  outcome: |
    Pricing that captures fair share of value delivered. Revenue growth 
    without volume growth. Reduced discounting and margin erosion. 
    Clear pricing logic that sales can articulate confidently.

  steps:
    - step: 1
      action: "Understand value delivered"
      responsible: Product Marketing
      duration: "8-16 hours"
      deliverable: "Value analysis"
      templates:
        - "Value quantification framework"
        - "Economic value estimation"
      best_practices:
        - Quantify customer outcomes in economic terms
        - Interview customers about value received
        - Identify value drivers (what creates most value?)
        - Segment value by customer type
      avoid:
        - Pricing based only on costs (misses value capture)
        - Assuming all customers get same value
        
    - step: 2
      action: "Research willingness to pay"
      responsible: Product Marketing
      duration: "8-20 hours"
      deliverable: "Willingness to pay research"
      templates:
        - "Van Westendorp price sensitivity meter"
        - "Conjoint analysis framework"
      best_practices:
        - Ask about value, not just acceptable price
        - Use indirect pricing questions (Van Westendorp)
        - Segment willingness to pay by customer type
        - Consider feature-level willingness to pay
      avoid:
        - Taking first answer as truth (people understate WTP)
        - Asking "what would you pay?" directly (leads to low answers)
        
    - step: 3
      action: "Analyze competitive pricing"
      responsible: Product Marketing
      duration: "4-8 hours"
      deliverable: "Competitive pricing analysis"
      templates:
        - "Competitor pricing matrix"
        - "Pricing model comparison"
      best_practices:
        - Understand competitor pricing models (not just numbers)
        - Analyze packaging and tiers
        - Consider total cost of ownership, not just price
        - Note where you can command premium based on differentiation
      avoid:
        - Matching competitor prices blindly
        - Ignoring pricing models (subscription vs. perpetual, per-seat vs. usage)
        
    - step: 4
      action: "Develop pricing model and packaging"
      responsible: Product Marketing / Finance
      duration: "8-16 hours"
      deliverable: "Pricing model recommendation"
      templates:
        - "Pricing model evaluation matrix"
        - "Package design framework"
      best_practices:
        - Align pricing model with value delivery
        - Create clear, understandable tiers
        - Use packaging to serve different segments
        - Include growth path (upsell opportunities)
      avoid:
        - Overly complex pricing confusing customers
        - Pricing that punishes growth (usage pricing that scales badly)
        
    - step: 5
      action: "Set specific price points"
      responsible: Product Marketing / Finance
      duration: "4-8 hours"
      deliverable: "Price list"
      templates:
        - "Price point calculation template"
        - "Margin analysis worksheet"
      best_practices:
        - Price based on value with margin validation
        - Use psychological pricing (ending in 9, round numbers)
        - Leave room for discounting (if needed)
        - Consider price anchoring (high tier makes middle attractive)
      avoid:
        - Cost-plus pricing (misses value opportunity)
        - Arbitrary discounting that undermines pricing logic
        
    - step: 6
      action: "Develop discounting strategy"
      responsible: Sales Leadership / Product Marketing
      duration: "4-6 hours"
      deliverable: "Discounting guidelines"
      templates:
        - "Discount approval matrix"
        - "Value exchange framework"
      best_practices:
        - Discount for something in return (term, volume, reference)
        - Set clear approval thresholds
        - Track discounting patterns for optimization
        - Train sales on value selling vs. discounting
      avoid:
        - Blanket discounting that erodes value perception
        - Discounts without approval process
        
    - step: 7
      action: "Create pricing communication"
      responsible: Product Marketing
      duration: "4-8 hours"
      deliverable: "Pricing page and sales materials"
      templates:
        - "Pricing page layout"
        - "Price justification talk tracks"
      best_practices:
        - Make pricing clear and understandable
        - Highlight value at each tier
        - Include ROI justification
        - Prepare sales for pricing objections
      avoid:
        - Hidden pricing that creates distrust
        - No context for why pricing is what it is

    frequency: "Major review annually, optimization quarterly"
    triggers:
      - Significant cost structure change
      - Major product release
      - Competitive pricing shift

practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Moving from Cost-Plus to Value-Based Pricing"
    practitioner: "Head of Product Marketing"
    organization_context: |
      35-person B2B startup with pricing set at launch based on costs 
      plus margin. Never revisited. Growing customer base shows some 
      customers get massive value, others moderate. Same price for all.
    situation: |
      Sales reporting that some deals close easily at current price 
      (suggesting underpriced) while others are extremely price-sensitive. 
      CFO calculating that average customer saves $100K from product but 
      we charge $10K. "We're leaving money on the table."
    trigger: |
      Board review of unit economics. Investor asked: "What's your 
      pricing power? When did you last raise prices?" Answer: never. 
      Clear directive to develop value-based pricing.
    actions: |
      Started with customer value research—interviewed 15 customers 
      asking: "What value do you get from our product? What would it 
      cost to solve this without us?" Quantified outcomes: average 
      customer saves 40 hours per month (labor cost), reduces errors by 
      60% (cost avoidance), and accelerates delivery by 2 weeks (revenue 
      acceleration). Calculated economic value at $50K-150K annually 
      depending on customer size. Current pricing of $10K-15K means we 
      capture 10-20% of value created. Industry benchmark suggests 
      capturing 20-30% of value is fair. Developed three tiers based on 
      company size and usage—correlates with value received. New pricing: 
      Growth ($18K), Business ($36K), Enterprise ($60K+). Created value 
      justification for each tier showing ROI. Developed sales training 
      on selling value, not features. Launched to new customers immediately, 
      created grandfathering plan for existing (6-month notice for 15% 
      increase).
    outcome: |
      New customer ACV increased 60% with no drop in win rate. Existing 
      customer increases accepted with minimal churn (value justification 
      worked). Annual revenue impact: $800K additional from pricing 
      alone. Sales team more confident in pricing conversations. 
      Customer perception: "worth the investment" vs. "cheap tool."
    lessons:
      - Most B2B companies underprice (especially early-stage)
      - Customer value research reveals pricing opportunity
      - Segmented pricing captures value differences across customers
      - Value selling training essential for new pricing

    name: "Restructuring Pricing for Market Expansion"
    practitioner: "VP Revenue"
    organization_context: |
      75-person company expanding from enterprise-only to mid-market. 
      Current pricing designed for large deals ($50K+ ACV). Mid-market 
      prospects expressing interest but balking at price points.
    situation: |
      Pipeline filling with mid-market opportunities but conversion low. 
      Feedback: "love the product, can't afford it." Current minimum 
      deal is $36K—too high for mid-market budget. Options: discount 
      heavily (margin hit) or redesign pricing.
    trigger: |
      Strategic decision to pursue mid-market. CEO directive: "Create 
      pricing that works for mid-market without cannibalizing enterprise."
    actions: |
      Analyzed mid-market segment: smaller teams, fewer features needed, 
      lower value received, tighter budgets, faster sales cycles. Current 
      product includes enterprise features mid-market doesn't need. 
      Designed new mid-market tier: stripped to core features that 
      mid-market values, priced at $12K-24K ACV range. Created feature 
      fencing—clear differentiation between mid-market and enterprise 
      tiers. Enterprise features: advanced integrations, dedicated 
      support, custom reporting. Developed migration path from mid-market 
      to enterprise as companies grow. Built sales qualification 
      criteria—which tier for which customer. Created separate marketing 
      and sales motion for mid-market (self-serve where possible). Tested 
      pricing with 10 mid-market prospects—validated price point and 
      packaging.
    outcome: |
      Mid-market segment launched with right-sized pricing. Win rate for 
      mid-market improved from 10% to 35%. Enterprise not cannibalized—
      feature fencing clear enough. Created growth path: 20% of 
      mid-market customers upgrade to enterprise within 18 months. 
      TAM expanded significantly with new segment.
    lessons:
      - Different segments need different pricing (not just discounts)
      - Feature fencing prevents cannibalization
      - Price what segment values, not what you have
      - Build upgrade path into pricing design

    name: "Price Increase After Years of Flat Pricing"
    practitioner: "CEO / Head of Finance"
    organization_context: |
      100-person company with pricing unchanged for 4 years. Costs have 
      increased, product significantly improved, but fear of customer 
      reaction prevented price increases. Margin pressure mounting.
    situation: |
      Costs up 30% in 4 years, prices flat. Margins squeezed. Competitors 
      have raised prices twice. Product dramatically better—added major 
      features. Yet fear of churn prevents pricing discussion.
    trigger: |
      Annual planning revealed margin trajectory is unsustainable. 
      Options: cut costs, raise funding, or increase prices. Board 
      pushed for pricing action: "You've earned a price increase."
    actions: |
      Developed price increase strategy over 8 weeks. Researched customer 
      value: product now delivers 40% more value than 4 years ago 
      (features, reliability, integrations). Analyzed competitive pricing: 
      we're now 20% below market (were at market 4 years ago). Calculated 
      increase needed: 15% to restore margins, 20% to match market. 
      Designed increase rollout: 90-day advance notice, value communication 
      emphasizing improvements over 4 years, loyalty recognition for 
      long-term customers (smaller increase), lock-in offer for early 
      renewal at old price. Trained customer success and sales on 
      conversations. Created FAQ for common objections. Modeled churn 
      scenarios: even with 5% churn, net revenue up. Communicated increase 
      with CEO letter explaining value delivered and investment in product.
    outcome: |
      15% price increase implemented. Churn: 2% (much lower than feared). 
      Most customers accepted with minimal pushback—value communication 
      worked. Margin restored to healthy level. Established precedent 
      for regular (annual) price optimization. Some customers renewed 
      early at old price—cash flow boost.
    lessons:
      - Price increase fear often greater than reality
      - Value communication essential—show what they're getting
      - 90+ days notice with explanation is respectful
      - Lock-in offers can accelerate renewals (cash flow)

risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Price increase causes unexpected churn"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Advance notice and value communication. Model scenarios. Start 
        with smaller increase to test. Loyalty recognition for at-risk 
        accounts. Customer success proactive outreach.
        
    - risk: "Complex pricing confuses customers and sales"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Test pricing clarity with prospects before launch. Train sales 
        thoroughly. Create simple comparison tools. Get feedback and 
        simplify if needed.
        
    - risk: "Discounting undermines pricing strategy"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Clear discounting guidelines and approvals. Discount for value 
        (term, volume) not just to close. Track discounting patterns. 
        Sales compensation aligned with realized price.
        
    - risk: "Pricing set without adequate market validation"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Customer value research before pricing decisions. Test pricing 
        with prospects. Willingness to pay studies. Competitive 
        benchmarking.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Pricing becomes sales vs. marketing battle"
      impact: |
        Sales wants lower prices for easier closes. Marketing wants 
        higher prices for value positioning. Conflict and suboptimal 
        outcomes.
      prevention: |
        Cross-functional pricing decisions. Data-driven approach (win 
        rates, value research). Clear roles: marketing proposes, sales 
        inputs, leadership decides. Shared metrics for success.
        
    - risk: "Fear prevents necessary pricing optimization"
      impact: |
        Prices never raised despite value increase. Margin erosion over 
        time. Under-investment in product. Eventual crisis.
      prevention: |
        Regular pricing review cadence. Board-level pricing discussion. 
        Benchmark against market. Model price increase scenarios. Start 
        small to build confidence.
