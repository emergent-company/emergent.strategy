definition:
  purpose: |
    Ad spend optimization ensures marketing budget generates 
    maximum return. Every dollar should work as hard as 
    possible. This process brings discipline to paid media 
    investment decisions.
    
    Why optimization matters:
    
    1. Budget efficiency. Startups have limited marketing 
       budgets. Waste is unacceptable.
    
    2. Scalability. You can only scale what you can measure 
       and optimize. Efficient spend scales; inefficient 
       spend just loses money faster.
    
    3. Learning. Optimization generates insights about what 
       works - audiences, messages, channels.
    
    4. Competitive advantage. Better optimization means more 
       output per dollar than competitors.
    
    5. Accountability. Leadership wants to know marketing 
       spend is generating returns.
    
    Key optimization dimensions:
    
    1. Channel allocation: Where to invest across platforms
    2. Campaign optimization: Performance within platforms
    3. Audience optimization: Who to target
    4. Creative optimization: What message works
    5. Bidding optimization: How to bid efficiently
    
  outcome: |
    Improved ROAS (Return on Ad Spend). Lower customer 
    acquisition costs. Clear visibility into marketing 
    efficiency. Confidence to scale spending on what works.
