definition:
  purpose: |
    Content strategy answers: "What should we create, for whom, and why?" It's 
    not about writing blog posts—it's about building an asset that attracts and 
    converts your target audience over time.
    
    What content strategy provides:
    - A plan for what to create (not just random ideas)
    - Clarity on who you're creating for (audience, not vanity)
    - Connection to business outcomes (leads, not just traffic)
    - A sustainable system (repeatable, not heroic efforts)
    
    Warning signs of missing content strategy:
    - "We should write more blog posts" (activity, not strategy)
    - Content creation is reactive to random requests
    - Can't connect content to pipeline
    - No clear content priorities or themes
    
    The strategic question: "What content would be so valuable to our target 
    customer that they'd seek us out?" That's the starting point.
    
  outcome: |
    A content strategy that:
    - Attracts your target audience
    - Establishes expertise and trust
    - Generates leads and pipeline
    - Operates as a sustainable system

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Founder starts content from scratch"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: "20-person seed stage, no marketing hire yet, founder realizes they need content"
    situation: |
      Sam (technical founder) has built a product with early customers but no 
      content presence. When potential customers search for solutions, Sam's 
      company doesn't appear. Competitors have blogs, thought leadership, and 
      organic reach. Sam knows content matters but doesn't know where to start. 
      The question is: how do you build content without a content person?
    trigger: "Lost deal because prospect said 'I couldn't find any information about you online'"
    actions: |
      1. Sam decides to start content personally before hiring. Commits to 
         writing one piece per week for 3 months.
      2. Starts with what he knows: customer conversations. Writes first blog 
         post answering the most common question prospects ask.
      3. Defines simple content pillars (2): "How to [solve problem]" and 
         "Industry trends/perspectives."
      4. Builds minimal process: Mondays write, Fridays publish, share on 
         LinkedIn. No fancy tools—just Google Docs and the company blog.
      5. After 6 weeks, 6 posts published. One post gets picked up and shared. 
         Sam notices traffic increasing, gets first inbound lead mentioning blog.
      6. Month 3: Hires part-time contractor to help with production. Sam 
         does interviews/ideas, contractor writes first drafts.
      7. Month 6: Content generating consistent leads. Makes case for full-time 
         content hire. Transition from founder-led to team-led content.
    outcome: |
      Built content presence from zero with minimal investment. Proven content 
      drives leads before hiring. Founder voice established as thought leader. 
      Now ready to scale with hire. Key learning: start with customer questions, 
      not content calendars.
    lessons:
      - "Founders can bootstrap content before hiring"
      - "Customer questions are the best content topics"
      - "Consistency beats quality at the start"
      - "LinkedIn is powerful distribution for B2B"
      - "Prove content works before hiring for it"
      - "Transition from founder-led to team-led gradually"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Building content engine at scale-up"
    practitioner: "Head of Content"
    organization_context: "80-person Series B, growing marketing team, need content to support demand gen"
    situation: |
      Marcus (newly hired Head of Content) joins with a mandate: "Build content 
      that drives pipeline." The company has scattered content—some blog posts, 
      some case studies, no strategy. Demand gen is running paid ads but needs 
      content for nurturing. Sales wants more case studies. Everyone has 
      opinions, but nobody owns content. Marcus needs to build a content engine 
      from scratch.
    trigger: "CMO says 'I need content that actually generates pipeline, not just traffic'"
    actions: |
      1. Marcus starts with research: Interviews sales, reviews top deals, talks 
         to customers. Learns what content influences buying decisions.
      2. Audits existing content: 50 blog posts, 5 case studies, scattered 
         resources. Most content is product-focused, not problem-focused. Low 
         SEO performance.
      3. Defines content strategy:
         - Primary objective: Demand generation (leads, pipeline)
         - Secondary: Thought leadership (credibility)
         - 4 content pillars aligned with buyer problems
         - Content mapped to buyer journey
      4. Builds team: Hires 2 content creators (1 writer, 1 video). Sets up 
         contractor network for overflow.
      5. Creates editorial calendar: 3-month plan, 4 blog posts/week, 2 videos/
         month, 1 case study/month. Balanced across pillars and journey stages.
      6. Establishes production process: Content briefs, editorial workflow, 
         review cycle, publishing SLA.
      7. Sets up measurement: UTMs on all content, lead attribution, monthly 
         performance review.
      8. Coordinates with demand gen: Content fuels email nurture sequences, 
         landing pages, and retargeting.
      9. Six months in: Content-attributed pipeline at 25% of total. Organic 
         traffic doubled. Sales using case studies in 40% of deals.
    outcome: |
      Built content engine generating 25% of pipeline. Organic traffic doubled. 
      Sales actively using content. Established as strategic function, not 
      just writing blog posts. Key learning: tie content to pipeline from 
      day one—vanity metrics don't get budget.
    lessons:
      - "Start with buyer problems, not content ideas"
      - "Audit before creating—know what you have"
      - "Tie metrics to pipeline, not just traffic"
      - "Build team around strategy, not just roles"
      - "Coordinate with demand gen from start"
      - "Sales enablement is content—not separate"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Content strategy after team transition"
    practitioner: "VP Marketing"
    organization_context: "150-person company, content lead just left, content engine broken"
    situation: |
      Rachel (VP Marketing) just lost her Head of Content who left for another 
      opportunity. The content calendar stopped, blog hasn't been updated in 6 
      weeks, and the team is confused. Worse, the content strategy lived in the 
      former Head of Content's head—nothing is documented. Rachel needs to 
      keep content going while hiring a replacement, and build a more resilient 
      system.
    trigger: "Content lead departure creates crisis - no documented strategy, no publishing"
    actions: |
      1. Rachel triages: What's critical? Gets team to resume publishing 
         existing content in queue. Quantity over perfection.
      2. Documents the implicit strategy: Interviews team members who worked 
         with former lead. Reconstructs pillars, audience, process.
      3. Creates written content strategy document: Strategy should survive 
         people. Documents pillars, audience, objectives, metrics.
      4. Distributes content ownership: Instead of one Head of Content, splits 
         responsibilities among team and freelancers. More resilient.
      5. Simplifies process: Former process was too dependent on one person. 
         Creates templates, checklists, and self-serve systems.
      6. Sets up coverage: Content manager promoted to interim lead. Brings in 
         senior freelancer for strategic guidance.
      7. Hires replacement thoughtfully: 8-week search, focus on candidates 
         who build systems and teams, not heroes who do it all.
      8. New hire onboards to documented strategy: First day, new Head of 
         Content understands pillars, audience, process, metrics.
    outcome: |
      Content continued during transition with minimal drop in publishing. 
      Documented strategy enabled faster onboarding of replacement. More 
      resilient system with distributed ownership. Key learning: content 
      strategy must be documented, not in someone's head.
    lessons:
      - "Single points of failure are dangerous—document strategy"
      - "Systems survive people departures"
      - "Distribute ownership across team"
      - "Hire for system-building, not heroic output"
      - "Transition is opportunity to improve"
      - "Speed of new hire onboarding reflects documentation quality"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Content not published consistently"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Set realistic cadence based on capacity (1 post/week is fine). Build 
        content buffer (always 2 weeks ahead). Batch production. Use 
        repurposing to multiply output. Track publishing vs. plan.
        
    - risk: "Content doesn't drive leads"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Start with problems, not topics (what do buyers search?). Include 
        CTAs in all content. Create content for all journey stages, not 
        just awareness. Set up proper attribution from day one.
        
    - risk: "Content becomes generic"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Define unique POV early. Interview internal experts for insights.
        Take positions, don't just inform. Review content for 
        differentiation regularly.
        
    - risk: "Team creates content in silos"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: low
      mitigation: |
        Maintain central content calendar. Regular content team syncs.
        Clear content pillars guide decisions. Review process 
        catches misalignment.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Content seen as 'nice to have'"
      impact: |
        Content budget cut in downturn. Team understaffed. No executive 
        attention. Content quality and consistency decline.
      prevention: |
        Tie content to pipeline from start. Report on revenue metrics, 
        not vanity metrics. Show sales using content in deals. 
        Make content indispensable to demand gen.
        
    - risk: "Competing content priorities"
      impact: |
        Sales wants case studies. Product wants documentation. CEO wants 
        thought leadership. No focus, everything half-done.
      prevention: |
        Clear content objectives (max 2). Documented strategy with trade-offs.
        Regular priority alignment with stakeholders. Capacity planning 
        to manage expectations.
