  purpose: |
    Loyalty programs turn satisfied customers into committed 
    advocates. They reward ongoing engagement and create 
    switching costs that improve retention.
    
    Why loyalty matters in B2B SaaS:
    
    1. Retention economics. Retaining customers costs less 
       than acquiring new ones. Loyal customers have higher 
       LTV.
    
    2. Expansion revenue. Loyal customers expand more. They 
       trust you to solve more problems.
    
    3. Referrals. Your best customers are your best source 
       of new customers. Loyalty drives referrals.
    
    4. Brand advocacy. Loyal customers become advocates - 
       reviews, references, case studies.
    
    5. Competitive moat. Strong customer relationships are 
       hard for competitors to replicate.
    
    Key loyalty program elements:
    
    1. Recognition: Acknowledge customer value and tenure
    2. Rewards: Tangible benefits for loyalty
    3. Access: Exclusive opportunities and content
    4. Community: Connection with other customers
    5. Advocacy: Channels for customers to promote you
    
  outcome: |
    Improved customer retention. Increased referrals and 
    advocacy. Higher customer lifetime value. Stronger 
    competitive position through relationships.

  if_over_engineered: |
    Complex programs nobody understands. High 
    administrative overhead. Over-promising on 
    benefits. Program cost exceeds value.
