definition:
  purpose: |
    Email remains the highest-ROI marketing channel for most B2B companies. While 
    everyone's inbox is crowded, email that's targeted, valuable, and timely still 
    works. The goal isn't to send more email - it's to send the RIGHT email to the 
    RIGHT person at the RIGHT time.
    
    Email marketing serves multiple purposes:
    - Nurture: Move prospects from awareness to consideration
    - Conversion: Drive specific actions (demo, trial, purchase)
    - Retention: Keep customers engaged and informed
    - Reactivation: Win back churned or dormant users
    
    The difference between spam and valuable email is relevance. If you're sending 
    the same email to everyone, you're probably sending spam.
    
  outcome: |
    An email marketing program that:
    - Generates qualified leads at predictable rates
    - Nurtures prospects through the buying journey
    - Supports sales with warm, engaged contacts
    - Drives measurable revenue (attributed)

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Founder running email for the first time"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: "5-person early-stage startup, no marketing hire, 500 email subscribers from early users and content"
    situation: |
      Alex (CEO, first-time founder) has 500 email subscribers: 200 beta users, 
      150 content subscribers, 150 misc contacts. They've never sent a "real" 
      email campaign - just one-off personal emails. Investors say "you need to 
      nurture your list." Alex doesn't know where to start. Fear: don't want to 
      spam people and have them unsubscribe.
    trigger: "Investor feedback + upcoming product launch needs awareness; 500 subscribers sitting unused"
    actions: |
      1. Alex accepts email is necessary and decides to start simple. Goal: 
         establish regular communication, build trust, eventually launch.
      2. Sets up Mailchimp (free for <500 subscribers). Imports list. Cleans 
         obvious bad emails. Down to 480.
      3. Creates simple brand template - logo, simple layout, unsubscribe footer.
         No design, just readable.
      4. Decides on monthly newsletter format: 1 update from Alex (product 
         progress), 1 useful insight (market observation), 1 ask (feedback, 
         beta signup, etc.).
      5. Writes first email personally - no marketing speak:
         Subject: "What we've learned from 200 beta users"
         Content: Genuine learnings, what's working, what's next. Ends with 
         "Reply and tell me what you think."
      6. Sends to small test group (20 people). 8 open, 2 reply. Realizes email 
         works - people do read it.
      7. Sends to full list. Results: 35% open rate, 5 replies, 2 unsubscribes.
         Alex realizes: authentic > polished.
      8. Commits to monthly email. By month 4, open rate stable at 30%, list 
         grown to 700 through organic adds. Several investors forward the email 
         to other founders: "This is how to do updates."
    outcome: |
      Monthly newsletter established with 30%+ open rate. Built reputation for 
      transparency. When product launched, email drove 40% of first-week signups. 
      Key learning: authentic founder voice beats marketing polish.
    lessons:
      - "Start before you're ready - your list will forgive imperfection"
      - "Founder voice is your superpower early on - don't try to sound like a big company"
      - "Monthly is fine - quality > frequency"
      - "Personal tone gets replies and engagement"
      - "Email from founder builds relationship with early users"
      - "Don't fear unsubscribes - they're helping you clean your list"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Marketing manager building email engine"
    practitioner: "Marketing Manager"
    organization_context: "40-person Series A B2B SaaS, 5,000 email subscribers, inbound-focused but email underutilized"
    situation: |
      Jordan (Marketing Manager) joined and found email in disarray: 5,000 
      subscribers, but only sporadic newsletters (3 in last 6 months). No 
      automation, no segmentation, no lead scoring. Sales complains leads are 
      cold. Marketing sends email when there's a product launch, otherwise 
      silence. List engagement dropping - 15% open rate now.
    trigger: "New hire tasked with 'fixing email'; CEO wants inbound to generate 40% of pipeline"
    actions: |
      1. Jordan audits the list: 5,000 total, but 1,500 haven't opened in 6 
         months (dead weight). Segments: engaged (3,500), dormant (1,500).
      2. Moves to HubSpot (company already has it for CRM). Sets up proper 
         tracking, UTMs, integration with Salesforce.
      3. Plans re-engagement campaign for dormant 1,500: "We miss you - here's 
         what's new." Open rate: 8%. 100 re-engage, 1,400 move to sunset list 
         (will remove after 30 days of no engagement).
      4. For engaged 3,500, creates segmentation:
         - Persona: Developer (2,000), Business (1,500)
         - Stage: Early interest (2,000), Sales-ready (500), Customer (1,000)
      5. Creates automated sequences:
         - Welcome sequence: 5 emails over 2 weeks (general)
         - Developer nurture: 4 emails with technical content
         - Business nurture: 4 emails with ROI content
         - Pre-demo warm-up: 3 emails before sales call
      6. Establishes bi-weekly newsletter with mixed content. A/B tests subject 
         lines consistently. Open rate climbs to 22% in 2 months.
      7. Sets up lead scoring: opens = +1, clicks = +3, content download = +5.
         Leads above threshold auto-alert SDR. Sales loves it - "finally warm leads."
      8. After 90 days: email generates 30% of qualified leads. Pipeline from 
         email up 3x. List cleaned to 4,000 engaged subscribers with 25% average 
         open rate.
    outcome: |
      Email became a reliable lead engine: 30% of qualified leads, 25% open 
      rates, sales praising warm leads. 1,400 dormant contacts removed, improving 
      deliverability for remainder. Key learning: segmentation + automation 
      transforms email from broadcast to conversation.
    lessons:
      - "Audit list first - dead subscribers hurt deliverability"
      - "Segmentation is the difference between spam and relevance"
      - "Automation compounds: build once, runs forever"
      - "Lead scoring bridges marketing and sales - visibility into engagement"
      - "Re-engagement campaigns can save some dormant contacts"
      - "Consistent sending improves deliverability over time"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Recovering from email disaster"
    practitioner: "VP of Marketing"
    organization_context: "80-person scaleup, 20,000 email subscribers, just hit spam blacklist after aggressive campaign"
    situation: |
      Vanessa (VP Marketing) inherited a crisis: the previous marketing team 
      sent 20,000 emails promoting a new product. Problem: old purchased list 
      mixed with organic subscribers, aggressive subject lines ("Don't miss out!!"), 
      sent on a Monday morning. Result: 5% open rate, 3% spam complaints, 
      company email domain blacklisted by Gmail. All company email - including 
      sales - going to spam.
    trigger: "Email domain blacklisted; all company email affected; CEO furious"
    actions: |
      1. Crisis mode: Vanessa immediately contacts Gmail/Postmaster and major 
         ESPs. Learns recovery takes 2-4 weeks minimum if behavior changes.
      2. Identifies root causes:
         - Purchased list (likely full of spam traps)
         - No list hygiene (hadn't cleaned in 2 years)
         - Aggressive subject lines (triggered spam filters)
         - Volume spike (went from 1,000/month to 20,000 at once)
      3. Immediate actions:
         - Stops all marketing email immediately
         - Isolates sales email to subdomain (sales.company.com)
         - Removes purchased list entirely (2,000 contacts)
         - Runs hygiene on remaining 18,000: removes bounces, spam traps, 
           dormant >1 year. Down to 10,000.
      4. Reputation rebuild:
         - Re-permission campaign: email to 10,000 asking to re-confirm 
           subscription. Only 3,000 re-confirm.
         - Starts fresh with 3,000 confirmed subscribers.
         - Warms up slowly: 500/week, growing 20% each week.
      5. New safeguards:
         - Never purchase lists (policy)
         - Mandatory list hygiene quarterly
         - Subject line testing required
         - Volume pacing (never >10,000 at once)
         - Spam complaint monitoring (<0.1% threshold)
      6. After 6 weeks: domain reputation recovered. Open rates at 28% (higher 
         than before with clean list). Lesson expensive but learned.
    outcome: |
      Email reputation recovered after 6 weeks. Smaller but healthier list 
      (3,000 vs 20,000) with 28% open rates. Safeguards prevent future issues. 
      Key learning: list quality > size, and email mistakes have domain-wide 
      consequences.
    lessons:
      - "Never buy email lists - spam traps destroy deliverability"
      - "List hygiene isn't optional - clean quarterly at minimum"
      - "Volume spikes trigger spam filters - warm up gradually"
      - "Spam complaints affect your entire domain, not just marketing"
      - "Re-permission campaigns are painful but necessary after problems"
      - "Smaller, engaged list outperforms large, cold list every time"
      - "Aggressive tactics backfire - trust > tricks"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Email goes to spam"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Maintain list hygiene, remove inactive subscribers regularly, authenticate 
        domain (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), avoid spam trigger words, monitor spam complaint 
        rates (<0.1%). Use tools like Mail-Tester to check before sending.
        
    - risk: "Low engagement rates"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Test subject lines, segment for relevance, send at optimal times, provide 
        clear value in every email. A/B test consistently. If engagement drops, 
        re-permission campaign.
        
    - risk: "High unsubscribe rate"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Don't over-email, ensure relevance through segmentation, set expectations 
        at signup. If unsubscribes spike, reduce frequency or improve targeting.
        Some unsubscribes are healthy - they're cleaning your list.
        
    - risk: "No measurable impact"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Set up proper tracking (UTMs, conversion tracking), attribute leads and 
        pipeline to email. If can't measure, can't prove value. Report regularly 
        on email-sourced pipeline.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Email becomes spam channel"
      impact: |
        Damages brand, erodes subscriber trust, deliverability suffers, 
        unsubscribes accelerate, eventually renders email useless.
      prevention: |
        Quality > quantity. Every email must provide value. Never send just to 
        "hit a number." Segment aggressively so each email is relevant.
        Regularly ask: would I want to receive this?
        
    - risk: "Compliance violations"
      impact: |
        GDPR, CAN-SPAM, CASL violations can result in fines, legal issues, 
        and reputation damage. Email providers may suspend account.
