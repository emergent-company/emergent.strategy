definition:
  purpose: |
    SEO (Search Engine Optimization) makes your content discoverable 
    when people search for solutions you provide. For startups, 
    SEO is one of the most valuable long-term investments in 
    sustainable customer acquisition.
    
    Why SEO matters for startups:
    
    1. Compounding returns. SEO effort today drives traffic for 
       years. Unlike paid, does not stop when budget stops.
    
    2. High intent traffic. People searching have a problem and 
       are actively looking for solutions.
    
    3. Trust signal. Ranking well signals credibility to 
       prospects who do not know you.
    
    4. Cost advantage. Organic traffic is essentially "free" 
       after initial investment.
    
    5. Competitive moat. Rankings are hard to take once earned. 
       Creates defensible position.
    
    SEO components:
    
    1. Technical SEO: Making your site crawlable and indexable. 
       Site speed, structure, schema markup.
    
    2. On-page SEO: Optimizing individual pages for target 
       keywords. Content, titles, meta descriptions.
    
    3. Content SEO: Creating content that matches search intent. 
       Blog posts, guides, documentation.
    
    4. Off-page SEO: Building authority through backlinks. 
       PR, guest posts, partnerships.
    
  outcome: |
    Growing organic traffic from target keywords. Website that 
    ranks for relevant searches. Sustainable acquisition channel 
    that compounds over time. Visibility when prospects search.
