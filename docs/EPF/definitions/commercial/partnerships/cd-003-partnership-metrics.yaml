definition:
  purpose: |
    Partnership metrics transform gut-feel relationship management into evidence-based 
    decisions. Without measurement, companies invest heavily in partnerships that 
    underperform while neglecting high-potential relationships. Metrics reveal which 
    partnerships actually drive revenue, which require intervention, and which should 
    be deprioritized. For early-stage companies, this means making smart bets on 
    limited partnership capacity. For scaling companies, it means allocating resources 
    efficiently across a growing partner ecosystem.
    
  outcome: |
    Clear visibility into partnership performance with actionable insights. Partners 
    ranked by revenue contribution, growth trajectory, and strategic value. Early 
    warning system for declining partnerships. Data-driven decisions on where to 
    invest partnership resources. Quantified ROI on partnership programs.

          - "Partner-Attributed ARR: Total ARR from partner channel"
          - "Revenue Share Paid: What you're paying partners (cost of channel)"
        activity_metrics:
          - "Leads Generated: Referrals or leads from partner"

          - "Revenue per Partner: Average revenue generated per active partner"
          - "Partner Ramp Time: Time from signing to meaningful contribution"
      best_practices:
        - "Start with 5-7 metrics maximum - you can add more later"
        - "Ensure you can actually collect data for each metric before committing"
        - "Have at least one metric from each category (revenue, activity, health, efficiency)"
        - "Define 'active partner' clearly - inactive partners distort averages"
      avoid:
        - Tracking too many metrics and tracking none well
        - Measuring only revenue (lagging) without activity (leading) indicators
        - Not having clear data sources for each metric
        - Comparing all partners equally regardless of tier or type

      attribution_rules:
        partner_sourced: "Partner created opportunity or made intro. First-touch attribution. Must be marked in CRM within 30 days."
        partner_influenced: "Partner participated in sales process. 50 percent credit if also sourced, 25 percent otherwise."
        attribution_window: "12 months from first partner touch"
      best_practices:
        - "Automate collection wherever possible - manual entry degrades over time"
        - "Make attribution rules clear BEFORE disputes arise"
        - "Include partner in attribution (they should know their credit)"
        - "Audit data quality monthly for first 3 months"
      avoid:
        - Relying on sales reps to manually tag partner involvement
        - No attribution window (disputes over old relationships)
        - Different definitions of partner-sourced across teams
        - Not validating data until quarterly report reveals problems

    - step: 3
      action: Build partnership scorecard
      responsible: Head of Partnerships
      duration: "2-3 days"
      deliverable: Partnership scorecard (spreadsheet or dashboard)

        - "Active Partner Count (vs. signed partner count)"
        - "Average Revenue per Active Partner"
      partner_tiers:
        strategic: "Top 10 percent by revenue, deep integration, executive relationship"
        growth: "Strong performance, potential for strategic tier"
        standard: "Meets baseline expectations, limited investment"
        at_risk: "Declining metrics, below threshold, needs intervention or exit"
      health_score_components:
        revenue_trajectory: "25 percent - Growing, flat, or declining?"
        activity_level: "25 percent - Leads, deals, engagement"
        relationship_quality: "25 percent - Communication, responsiveness"
        strategic_alignment: "25 percent - Fit with company direction"
      best_practices:
        - "Review scorecard weekly, but only take action monthly"
        - "Include trend arrows - direction matters more than absolute numbers"
        - "Limit Strategic tier to 5-10 partners regardless of company size"
        - "Share scorecard with partners (their section only) for alignment"
      avoid:
        - Too many tiers (3-4 is optimal)
        - Promoting partners to Strategic without capacity to support them
        - Not including action recommendations in scorecard
        - Reviewing data but not acting on it

    - step: 4

      partner_qbrs:
        strategic: "Quarterly, 60-90 min, executive attendance, joint goal setting"
        growth: "Semi-annual, 30-45 min, performance review focus"
        standard: "Annual or as needed, 30 min, relationship maintenance"
      best_practices:
        - "Block these reviews as recurring calendar events NOW"
        - "Send QBR invites 6 weeks ahead (executives calendar up fast)"
        - "Prepare scorecards 48 hours before internal reviews"
        - "Always send partner their numbers before QBR (no surprises)"
      avoid:
        - Scheduling reviews but not preparing materials
        - QBRs that are presentations, not conversations
        - Skipping reviews when busy
        - Same format for all partners regardless of tier

        slide_2: "Strategic Partner Update - top 5, wins/losses, pipeline"
        slide_3: "Partner Program ROI - CAC comparison, investment vs return"
      best_practices:
        - "Lead with business impact, not activity metrics"
        - "Always include trend (this month vs. last month/quarter)"
        - "Have one key insight ready beyond the numbers"
        - "Know the questions board will ask and have answers ready"
      avoid:
        - Too many metrics (stick to 5-7 per report)
        - No narrative (data without story is forgettable)
        - Different metrics every month (hard to track trends)
        - Hiding bad news

  cadence:
    frequency: "Weekly scan, Monthly review, Quarterly deep dive"
    trigger: "New partnership signing, at-risk alert, or quarterly cycle"
    duration: "2-4 hours weekly ongoing"
    ongoing:
      - Update scorecard weekly
      - Conduct QBRs per cadence by tier
      - Audit data quality monthly
      - Refine metric definitions annually

practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Founder Building First Partner Metrics"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      15-person B2B SaaS startup. Three active partnerships (one integration, 
      two resellers). No formal tracking - founder tracks informally via 
      monthly check-ins. Board asking for partner channel contribution.
    situation: |
      The CEO has been managing partner relationships personally but can't 
      answer board's question about ROI on partnership investment. Revenue 
      is tagged in CRM inconsistently, and there's no scorecard or review 
      process. CEO suspects one partner is underperforming but has no data.
    trigger: |
      Board meeting in 2 weeks. Need to present partnership contribution and 
      answer questions about partner channel strategy.
    actions: |
      1. Defined minimal metric set: partner-sourced revenue, leads per partner, 
         health score (manual rating 1-5 based on engagement).
      2. Spent 4 hours in Salesforce auditing and fixing partner source 
         attribution on all opportunities from past 6 months.
      3. Built simple scorecard in Google Sheets: 3 partners, 5 metrics each, 
         with month-over-month trend.
      4. Calculated partner CAC: total investment in partnerships divided by 
         partner-sourced customers.
      5. Discovered integration partner had 80 percent of partner revenue; one 
         reseller had zero revenue in 6 months.
      6. Created one-page summary showing partner channel at 22 percent of revenue.
    outcome: |
      Board meeting went well - clear answers to ROI questions. CEO identified 
      underperforming reseller and initiated exit conversation. Integration 
      partner recognized as strategic (scheduled executive QBR). Monthly 
      scorecard review added to calendar.
    lessons:
      - Simple metrics are better than no metrics
      - Auditing CRM data revealed attribution gaps that would have compounded
      - Board appreciated transparency about underperforming partner
      - Framework made future partner decisions easier to evaluate

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Partnership Manager Scaling from 5 to 25 Partners"
    practitioner: "Head of Partnerships"
    organization_context: |
      60-person B2B company with dedicated partnerships function. Currently 
      5 partners contributing $400K ARR. Goal to grow to 25 partners and 
      $2M partner-attributed revenue in 18 months.
    situation: |
      Current tracking is relationship-based: Head of Partnerships knows 
      each partner personally and manages through conversation. This won't 
      scale to 25 partners. Need systematic tracking, tiering, and review 
      cadence to grow without losing quality.
    trigger: |
      CEO approved headcount for partnerships team (3 people total). Need 
      infrastructure to onboard new team members and scale efficiently.
    actions: |
      1. Audited current partner tracking: discovered tribal knowledge and 
         inconsistent CRM usage. Documented everything known about 5 partners.
      2. Built partnership dashboard in Notion: partner profiles, metric 
         tracking, QBR notes, and action items in one place.
      3. Defined partner tiers with specific criteria: Strategic (over $100K ARR), 
         Growth ($25-100K), Standard (under $25K).
      4. Created QBR templates differentiated by tier.
      5. Established weekly team review cadence: 30-minute standup reviewing 
         alerts and priorities.
      6. Built partner onboarding playbook with 30-60-90 day milestones.
    outcome: |
      Scaled from 5 to 18 partners in 12 months with systematic tracking. 
      New team members ramped in 30 days using documented processes. Identified 
      that reseller partners had 3x better unit economics than integration 
      partners. Partner-attributed revenue grew from $400K to $1.4M.
    lessons:
      - Documenting tribal knowledge is prerequisite to scaling
      - Tier-based service levels prevent over-investing in small partners
      - Team review cadences create shared accountability
      - Data revealed insights that contradicted assumptions

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Executive Presenting Partner Program ROI to Board"
    practitioner: "VP Business Development"
    organization_context: |
      150-person Series B company with mature partner program. 45 active 
      partners across reseller, integration, and referral types. $3M 
      partner-attributed ARR. Board questioning continued investment.
    situation: |
      Some board members are skeptical of partnership investment. Direct 
      sales has predictable ROI; partnerships feel soft and hard to measure. 
      VP needs to demonstrate concrete ROI and defend the program.
    trigger: |
      Upcoming board meeting includes partnership strategy review. CFO sent 
      pointed questions about partner program costs vs. returns.
    actions: |
      1. Built comprehensive ROI model: total partnership investment vs. 
         partner-attributed revenue and pipeline.
      2. Calculated partner CAC vs. direct CAC: partner at $850, direct at 
         $1,400. Partner LTV:CAC at 4.2x vs. direct at 3.1x.
      3. Segmented analysis by partner type: referral partners had 6x ROI, 
         resellers had 2x, some integration partners were negative.
      4. Created graduated view showing how partner revenue compounds over time.
      5. Prepared honest assessment: acknowledged 12 underperforming partners 
         flagged for exit, with projected savings.
      6. Built forward-looking model: path to 25 percent of revenue from partners.
    outcome: |
      Board approved continued partnership investment with refinements. 
      Skeptical board member became advocate after seeing CAC comparison. 
      Agreed to exit 12 underperforming partners ($180K savings). Shifted 
      integration partner strategy based on ROI analysis.
    lessons:
      - Board skepticism often comes from lack of data, not opposition
      - Comparing partner CAC to direct CAC tells a compelling story
      - Proactively addressing underperformers shows strategic thinking
      - Segmented analysis reveals where to double down vs. cut

operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - CRM or system of record with partner attribution capability
    - Access to revenue data by source/channel
    - Clear partnership agreements defining terms
    
  common_blockers:
    - "Sales won't tag partner involvement - Make it mandatory, audit regularly"
    - "No budget for dashboard tools - Start with spreadsheets; upgrade at 15 partners"
    - "Partners dispute our numbers - Share methodology, align on attribution in contract"
    - "Too many metrics to track - Start with 5-7, add more only when solid"
    
  integration_points:
    - Sales: Attribution tagging, deal involvement tracking
    - Finance: Revenue share payments, program cost tracking
    - Product: Integration partner usage data
    - Marketing: Co-marketing activity tracking

risks:
  if_skipped: |
    Invest heavily in partnerships that don't perform. Miss warning signs of 
    declining partners. Can't answer board questions about ROI. Allocate 
    resources based on relationships rather than results.
    
  if_over_engineered: |
    Spend more time measuring than managing. Paralyze partners with reporting 
    requirements. Create metric gaming behavior. Lose sight of relationship 
    quality in pursuit of numbers.
