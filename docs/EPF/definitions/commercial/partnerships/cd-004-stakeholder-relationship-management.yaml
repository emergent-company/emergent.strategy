definition:
  purpose: |
    Stakeholder relationship management is the systematic approach to 
    identifying, prioritizing, engaging, and nurturing relationships with 
    individuals and organizations that can significantly impact your 
    company's success or failure.
    
    Stakeholders extend far beyond investors and customers:
    - Investors and board members
    - Partners and vendors
    - Industry influencers and analysts
    - Regulators and policy makers
    - Community and ecosystem players
    - Key talent and advisors
    - Media and press
    
    Why systematic stakeholder management matters:
    
    1. Relationships take time to build, but value can be needed quickly. 
       When you need a key introduction, regulatory help, or crisis 
       support, it is too late to start building the relationship.
    
    2. Stakeholder influence is asymmetric. A single well-connected 
       industry advisor can open doors that months of cold outreach 
       cannot. One hostile regulator can block your market.
    
    3. Memory fades. Without tracking, you forget who you met, what 
       you discussed, and what was promised. This leads to embarrassing 
       mistakes and lost opportunities.
    
    4. Founders become bottlenecks. As the company grows, the CEO 
       cannot personally maintain every relationship. Systematic handoffs 
       and team involvement become essential.
    
  outcome: |
    A stakeholder ecosystem that actively supports company success - 
    opening doors, providing advice, amplifying messages, and defending 
    during challenges. Clear visibility into relationship health. 
    Scalable processes that survive founder attention limits.

         - Top 5 customer champions: bi-weekly updates
         - Strategic partner CEO: quarterly dinners
      5. Set up weekly 30-minute block to review database and queue 
         outreach. Used reminders for follow-ups.
      6. For the conference contact who went cold, sent re-engagement 
         email: acknowledged gap, shared relevant company update, 
         asked for call.
      7. Established habit: log all meaningful interactions same day.
      8. Monthly review: check for at-risk relationships (30+ days 
         since contact for Tier 1).
    outcome: |
      Within 3 months, relationship health improved significantly. 
      Re-engaged 5 cold relationships. The conference contact responded 
      and became an enterprise champion. System takes 3-4 hours/week 
      but prevents dropped relationships.
    lessons:
      - Start tracking before you need it
      - Simple systems work if you use them
      - Reactivating dormant relationships is possible
      - Logging interactions is essential discipline

    name: "CEO Managing Relationship Overload"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: |
      Series B company, 60 people. CEO has 100+ relationships from 
      fundraising, partnerships, customers, advisors. Spending too 
      much time on relationship maintenance, dropping important balls.
    situation: |
      CEO calendar is packed with stakeholder meetings. Important 
      investor check-in was missed last month. Advisor complained 
      about lack of engagement. CEO feeling overwhelmed.
    trigger: |
      Board member mentioned that key investor partner had asked 
      about the company at an event and CEO had not been in touch 
      for months.
    actions: |
      1. Conducted honest relationship audit. Found 120 relationships 
         in various tracking systems. Many had gone cold.
      2. Forced prioritization: reduced Tier 1 from 35 to 15. Made 
         hard choices about what truly requires CEO attention.
      3. Identified relationships to delegate:
         - Partner relationships to VP BD
         - Customer relationships to VP CS
         - Analyst relationships to VP Marketing
         - Talent network to VP People
      4. For each delegation, did proper handoff:
         - Shared relationship context and history
         - Joint call to introduce new owner
         - Clear accountability and escalation path
      5. CEO retained: board, investors, Tier 1 advisors, strategic 
         partners at CEO level, key enterprise champions.
      6. Implemented Affinity CRM for unified tracking. Required all 
         relationship owners to log interactions.
      7. Created weekly stakeholder review: 30-minute meeting with 
         CoS to review engagement pipeline, identify at-risk 
         relationships, queue CEO actions.
      8. Immediately reached out to investor partner: apologized for 
         gap, scheduled dinner, provided detailed company update.
    outcome: |
      CEO relationship load reduced by 60%. Quality of maintained 
      relationships improved. Delegation created bandwidth for 
      strategic work. Investor relationship repaired with transparent 
      acknowledgment and renewed commitment.
    lessons:
      - Cannot maintain 100+ relationships personally
      - Delegation requires proper handoff
      - Prioritization means saying no to some relationships
      - Systematic tracking prevents balls being dropped

    name: "VP BD Building Strategic Partnership Ecosystem"
    practitioner: "VP Business Development"
    organization_context: |
      Mid-stage SaaS company entering new market. Need to build 
      partnership ecosystem quickly to gain distribution and 
      credibility. VP BD responsible for partnership stakeholders.
    situation: |
      Company expanding from SMB to enterprise. Needs system 
      integrator, agency, and technology partnerships to succeed. 
      VP BD has list of 50 potential partners but no systematic 
      approach to engaging them.
    trigger: |
      CEO asked for partnership pipeline review. VP BD realized there 
      was no structured approach to tracking partner relationships 
      and engagement progress.
    actions: |
      1. Mapped partnership universe by type:
         - System integrators (15): Accenture, Deloitte, boutiques
         - Agencies (20): Digital agencies, consultancies
         - Technology partners (10): Adjacent tools, platforms
         - Channel partners (5): Resellers, referral partners
      2. Researched each potential partner: company size, relevant 
         practice areas, key contacts, existing relationships.
      3. Prioritized based on: strategic fit, addressable opportunity, 
         accessibility, speed to partnership.
      4. Identified warmest paths: 12 partners had existing connections 
         through investors, customers, or team network.
      5. Built engagement pipeline:
         - Tier 1 (10): Priority targets with warm paths
         - Tier 2 (20): Good fit, cold outreach needed
         - Tier 3 (20): Future consideration
      6. For Tier 1, developed relationship maps: who knows whom, 
         decision makers, champions.
      7. Created outreach sequence: warm intro request, initial 
         meeting, discovery, partnership discussion, negotiation.
      8. Set up HubSpot deals for each partner target. Weekly pipeline 
         review with CEO.
      9. Tracked engagement metrics: meetings booked, conversations 
         progressing, partnerships signed.
    outcome: |
      Within 6 months, signed 4 partnerships from Tier 1, 2 from 
      Tier 2. Partnership pipeline became predictable. CEO had 
      visibility into progress. Systematic approach enabled parallel 
      pursuit of multiple partnerships.
    lessons:
      - Map the landscape before engaging
      - Warm paths are 3x more effective than cold
      - Pipeline approach brings predictability
      - Tracking enables accountability and learning
