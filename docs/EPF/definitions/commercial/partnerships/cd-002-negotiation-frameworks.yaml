definition:
  purpose: |
    Negotiation is where partnerships are won or lost. Most startups wing it - they 
    walk into partner/vendor/customer negotiations without a framework, end up 
    conceding too much or being too rigid, and either lose deals or sign bad ones.
    
    Good negotiation isn't about winning at the other party's expense. It's about 
    finding agreements that work for both sides while protecting your core interests.
    This requires: knowing your walk-away point, understanding what they value, and 
    having a structured approach to finding creative solutions.
    
    Without a framework, negotiations become personality-driven. The aggressive 
    founder leaves value on the table by damaging relationships. The conflict-averse 
    founder gives away too much. A framework makes good negotiation teachable and 
    repeatable.
    
  outcome: |
    Every significant negotiation follows a documented approach. Team members 
    can articulate BATNA, key terms, and decision criteria before entering 
    discussions. Post-negotiation reviews capture learnings for future deals.

      questions:
        - "What does success look like for this negotiation?"
        - "What are our must-haves vs nice-to-haves?"
        - "What are we willing to give to get what we need?"
      avoid:
        - Starting negotiations without clear objectives
        - Having too many must-haves (everything can't be essential)

      questions:
        - "What happens if this deal falls through?"
        - "What are our alternatives?"
        - "At what point is no deal better than a bad deal?"
      avoid:
        - Overestimating your alternatives

      questions:
        - "What's our reservation point (walk-away)?"
        - "What do we estimate as their reservation point?"
        - "Where is the overlap where both sides can agree?"
      avoid:
        - Starting with extreme positions just to have room to move

        - "What's our opening position and rationale?"
        - "What concessions can we make and in what order?"
        - "What are our non-negotiables and how do we explain them?"
      avoid:
        - Being inflexible on things that don't matter

      duration: "Varies by deal complexity"
      deliverable: "Agreed terms or clear next steps"
      questions:
        - "Are we staying within our approved ranges?"
        - "Are we building relationship or damaging it?"
        - "When do we need to pause and regroup?"
      avoid:
        - Making commitments without authority

        - "Did we achieve our objectives?"
        - "What worked well? What would we do differently?"
        - "What did we learn about the counterparty?"
      avoid:
        - Skipping debrief because deal is done
        - Only debriefing failed negotiations

    triggers:
      - Any partnership discussion entering term negotiation
      - Vendor contracts above threshold
      - Customer deals with non-standard terms

      - Train new team members on framework

practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "Founder Negotiating First Enterprise Customer"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      Early-stage SaaS startup, largest customer currently pays $500/month. 
      No enterprise sales experience. Need the logo for credibility but 
      cannot set bad precedents.
    situation: |
      An enterprise prospect wants to buy but is asking for significant 
      concessions: 60% discount, custom SLAs, security questionnaire, 90-day 
      payment terms, and 3-year contract with annual outs. The founder has 
      never negotiated an enterprise deal and is unsure what's reasonable.
    trigger: |
      Enterprise procurement team sent initial term sheet with aggressive 
      asks. Need to respond within one week with counter-proposal.
    actions: |
      1. Before negotiation, calculated BATNA: determined that losing this 
         deal would hurt but 3 more SMB customers could replace the revenue.
      2. Researched enterprise priorities through the champion contact: learned 
         that SLAs mattered more than price (reliability is their main concern).
      3. Defined must-haves: willing to do discount but not annual outs (churn 
         risk too high), SLAs acceptable, payment terms negotiable.
      4. During negotiation, asked clarifying questions before making offers: 
         "Help me understand why the annual out matters" - discovered it was 
         procurement policy, not actual intent to leave.
      5. Traded concessions strategically: offered 60% discount in exchange for 
         annual prepay instead of quarterly (gave on price, got cash flow).
      6. Held firm on deal-breaker: "We can't do annual outs, but we can include 
         a 90-day cure period for any SLA breaches."
      7. Documented every term for future playbook and noted which asks were 
         real priorities versus opening positions.
    outcome: |
      Closed first enterprise deal at $15K/year (60% discount from list but 
      still 2.5x largest customer). Annual prepay improved cash position. 
      No annual outs but added SLA cure period as compromise. Created negotiation 
      playbook template for future enterprise deals. Maintained relationship 
      and expanded to $45K in year two.
    lessons:
      - Enterprises expect pushback on initial terms - their first ask is not their final position
      - Asking questions before countering reveals which terms actually matter to them
      - Trading concessions (discount for prepay) creates value for both sides
      - Documenting lessons immediately after deal creates institutional knowledge

    name: "Negotiating Revenue Share with Strategic Partner"
    practitioner: "Head of Business Development"
    organization_context: |
      Series A B2B SaaS company with product-market fit but limited distribution. 
      Current CAC is high through direct sales. First channel partnership 
      opportunity with no precedent for terms.
    situation: |
      A larger company wants to resell the product and has proposed 40% revenue 
      share (they keep 40%, you get 60%). This is the first channel partner 
      and there's no internal data on what's fair or standard.
    trigger: |
      Partner sent standard reseller agreement with 40% margin. CEO asked 
      BD lead to negotiate but get the partnership done.
    actions: |
      1. Researched market norms: found typical SaaS reseller margins are 20-30%, 
         but 40% is reasonable if partner does full sales cycle.
      2. Mapped value exchange clearly: partner providing leads, sales, first-line 
         support; we provide product, implementation, customer success.
      3. Calculated BATNA: direct sales costs 30% of revenue in CAC, so 40% 
         to partner is only marginally worse if they do everything.
      4. Reframed negotiation from percentage to total value: asked partner 
         for volume commitment (40% of $10M better than 20% of $2M).
      5. Tied margin to effort: proposed 40% if they handle full cycle including 
         demos, 25% if we do demos and they just close.
      6. Built in performance adjustments: start at 35%, drops to 25% if they 
         hit 2x volume (incentivizes growth while reducing our margin at scale).
      7. Explored trade-offs: non-exclusive for lower margin, minimum commits 
         for higher margin, support responsibility affects split.
    outcome: |
      Signed partnership at 32% margin (they wanted 40%, we wanted 20%). They 
      committed to 50 deals in year one minimum. Margin steps down to 25% after 
      100 deals. Clear responsibility matrix for sales vs. post-sales. Agreement 
      to revisit terms annually. Both parties satisfied with balanced outcome.
    lessons:
      - Never negotiate percentage in isolation - volume commitments matter more
      - Performance-based margin tiers align incentives for both parties  
      - Take it or leave it from a partner is a red flag - real partners negotiate
      - Clear responsibility matrices prevent disputes later

  - id: ps-003
    name: "Renegotiating Vendor Contract at Renewal"
    practitioner: "Head of Operations"
    organization_context: |
      50-person startup, 150 users on critical SaaS tool that's deeply 
      integrated into workflows. Two-year customer with good relationship 
      but no formal negotiation at renewal previously.
    situation: |
      Vendor notified of 25% price increase at renewal (60 days notice). 
      The tool is critical but not irreplaceable. Switching would be painful 
      (2-3 month migration) but possible if needed.
    trigger: |
      Received renewal quote with 25% increase and auto-renewal deadline 
      in 45 days. CFO asked Ops lead to negotiate or find alternatives.
    actions: |
      1. Calculated true switching cost: not just license savings but 2-3 months 
         of disruption, data migration, retraining. Determined BATNA cost was 
         approximately $40K in total switching expense.
      2. Researched alternatives: got quotes from three competitors, found one 
         offering 30% less than current vendor's new price.
      3. Understood vendor's position: verified this was company-wide increase, 
         not targeting us specifically. Vendor is profitable, not desperate.
      4. Did not accept first offer: replied that 25% is unworkable given our 
         two-year loyalty and user expansion.
      5. Led with relationship: "We've grown from 50 to 150 users and been vocal 
         advocates. We expected partnership pricing, not a surprise increase."
      6. Presented concrete alternative: "Competitor X quoted 30% below your new 
         price. We prefer to stay but need you to meet us halfway."
      7. Proposed creative solution: offered 2-year commitment in exchange for 
         price lock at current rate plus 10% (not 25%).
      8. Escalated when stonewalled: asked to speak with sales leadership when 
         initial rep said increase was final.
    outcome: |
      Final negotiated increase was 12% instead of 25% (saved $18K over two 
      years). Secured price lock for 24 months. Added 50-user expansion at 
      same per-user rate. Relationship preserved with vendor, now flagged as 
      key account. Created renewal playbook for all vendor contracts.
    lessons:
      - Always negotiate renewals - first quote is never the best offer
      - Real alternatives (with quotes) dramatically strengthen position
      - Multi-year commitments are valuable currency in vendor negotiations
      - Escalating past front-line reps often unlocks better terms

operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - Clear authority levels (who can approve what terms)
    - Basic understanding of legal/financial implications
    - Time to prepare (rushed negotiations favor the prepared party)
    
  common_blockers:
    - "We don't have leverage → You always have BATNA; find alternatives"
    - "They won't negotiate → Everyone negotiates; find what they value"
    - "We need this too badly → Desperation is a choice; improve alternatives"
    - "Legal is too slow → Pre-approve standard terms and ranges"
    - "Founder gets emotional → Role-play before, use prepared talking points"
    
  integration_points:
    - "Legal: Term sheet review, contract drafting, risk assessment"
    - "Finance: Financial modeling, approval for non-standard terms"
    - "Product: Technical feasibility of custom commitments"
    - "Leadership: Approval for strategic terms, escalation path"
    
  success_criteria:
    - Deals close with terms within approved ranges
    - Relationship maintained or improved post-negotiation
    - Learnings documented and applied to future deals

risks:
  if_skipped: |
    Negotiations become personality-dependent. Aggressive negotiators damage 
    relationships; passive ones give away too much. No institutional learning 
    from deals. Same mistakes repeated across team members.
  if_over_engineered: |
    Negotiations become bureaucratic. Deal desk slows everything down. 
    Counterparties frustrated by inflexibility. Good deals lost to faster 
    competitors. Analysis paralysis on every term.
