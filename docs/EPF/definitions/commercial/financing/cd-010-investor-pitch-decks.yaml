definition:
  purpose: |
    The pitch deck is your story in a box - a compressed narrative that convinces 
    investors to give you money and, more importantly, to give you their time for 
    a deeper conversation. Most decks fail not because the company is bad, but 
    because the story is unclear, the proof points are missing, or the ask is vague.
    
    A good deck does three things:
    1. Gets you the meeting (first impression, often cold email)
    2. Guides the conversation (structure for your pitch)
    3. Lives in the investor's memory (forwarded to partners, referenced later)
    
    Your deck competes with thousands of others. It needs to pass the "30-second test" 
    (investor scanning quickly) AND the "30-minute test" (deep dive conversation).
    
  outcome: |
    A pitch deck that consistently converts to meetings, enables compelling 
    conversations, and is remembered when investment committee discusses you.
    Investors understand the opportunity, believe the team, and see a path to 
    their target returns.

operational_context:
  prerequisites:
    - Company metrics accessible and accurate
    - Financial model exists
    - Clarity on how much to raise and why
    - Time blocked for iteration

    - "Too much text → Cut ruthlessly, one idea per slide"
    - "Metrics are embarrassing → Context > spin (show trajectory, explain why)"
    - "No design skills → Outsource or use clean templates (Figma community)"

# Practitioner Scenarios - How This Plays Out in Real Organizations
practitioner_scenarios:
  - id: ps-001
    name: "First-time founder building seed deck"
    practitioner: "CEO / First-time Founder"
    organization_context: "2-person pre-seed startup, no pitch experience, building first deck for angel/seed fundraise"
    situation: |
      Priya (CEO) and Dev (CTO) have been building for 6 months with their own money. 
      They have early users (500 beta) but no revenue yet. Priya has never raised 
      money or built a pitch deck. She's seen examples online but they all look 
      polished in ways she can't achieve. She's worried her deck will look 
      "amateur" and she doesn't know what metrics matter at this stage.
    trigger: "Runway running low (4 months left), need to start fundraising"
    actions: |
      1. Priya starts by writing (not designing) - 2 hours answering: "If I had 
         5 minutes with an investor, what would I say?" This becomes the outline.
      2. Finds 5 pitch decks from companies at similar stage (AngelList, deck 
         databases). Studies structure, not design. Notes: they're simpler than 
         expected.
      3. Creates rough slides in Google Slides using a clean template. Focus on 
         content, not beauty. 15 slides, one idea each.
      4. For the "traction" slide (her biggest worry), frames honestly: "500 beta 
         users, 40% weekly retention, 0 marketing spend." Context: these are 
         organic signups from a waitlist.
      5. Biggest struggle: market size. Spends 4 hours on TAM/SAM/SOM. Realizes 
         she was overthinking - uses bottom-up approach (# of target customers 
         × average spend).
      6. Asks an advisor (experienced founder) to do mock pitch. Advisor's 
         feedback: "Your problem slide is weak - I don't feel the pain." Priya 
         adds customer quotes and a real example.
      7. Presents to 3 angel investors (warm intros) as practice. Takes notes on 
         questions. Common question: "How will you acquire customers?" Adds slide 
         on go-to-market.
      8. Finds a designer friend to spend 2 hours on polish. Not a redesign - just 
         consistent fonts, aligned elements, cleaner visuals.
    outcome: |
      Raised $500K seed from 8 angels in 6 weeks. Meeting conversion was 35% from 
      warm intros. Deck evolved significantly - version 12 is what worked. Key 
      learning: the deck is never "done" - it's a living document that improves 
      with every conversation.
    lessons:
      - "Start with writing, not slides - nail the narrative first"
      - "At early stage, trajectory matters more than absolute numbers"
      - "Mock pitches are invaluable - advisors see what you can't"
      - "Simple template + clear content > fancy design with muddled story"
      - "Track questions asked - they reveal deck gaps"
      - "Expect 10+ versions before you're happy"

  - id: ps-002
    name: "Pivot narrative for Series A deck"
    practitioner: "CEO / Second-time Founder"
    organization_context: "15-person seed-stage company, pivoted 8 months ago, now raising Series A with new narrative"
    situation: |
      Marcus (CEO) raised a $2M seed 18 months ago for a consumer social app. It 
      didn't work - acquired 100K users but couldn't monetize. 8 months ago, pivoted 
      to B2B (same underlying tech, different use case). Now has $30K MRR growing 
      25% m/m. Needs to raise $8M Series A. Challenge: how to tell the pivot story 
      without looking like he failed.
    trigger: "Ready for Series A, but deck needs to explain pivot compellingly"
    actions: |
      1. Marcus drafts two versions of the story:
         - Version A: "We pivoted" (honest but potentially negative)
         - Version B: "We discovered a bigger opportunity" (reframe)
         Tests both with advisors. Feedback: Version B is better but needs specifics.
      2. Structures the pivot narrative:
         - "We started in consumer because we saw [insight]"
         - "We built [technology] that worked"
         - "We discovered enterprise had 10x the willingness to pay"
         - "Same tech, bigger market, faster path to revenue"
      3. The "traction" section becomes key: $30K MRR, 8-month-old business, 
         25% m/m growth. Frames as "B2B traction since pivot" not "total company 
         history."
      4. Addresses the elephant: "What about the consumer business?" Answer: 
         "We learned invaluable lessons about [specific thing] that we couldn't 
         have learned any other way. And our tech is battle-tested at 100K user 
         scale."
      5. Creates detailed appendix on unit economics - knowing that pivot 
         skepticism will drive extra diligence.
      6. Practices "the pivot question" (he knows it's coming) until he can answer 
         confidently: "The consumer market taught us X, but enterprise is where 
         we build a billion-dollar business."
      7. First 3 pitches: 2 investors explicitly asked about pivot risk. Marcus's 
         prepared answer worked. Third meeting went to partner meeting.
    outcome: |
      Raised $10M Series A (more than planned). The pivot story, well-told, became 
      a strength: "This team pivots based on data, not stubbornness." Key: Marcus 
      led with confidence, not apology. 4 of 6 partner meetings mentioned liking 
      the pivot story.
    lessons:
      - "Frame pivot as 'discovered bigger opportunity' not 'failed and changed'"
      - "Prepare specifically for 'what about the old business' question"
      - "New-business traction should be prominent - clean slate from pivot"
      - "Past experience can be asset: 'battle-tested tech'"
      - "Confidence in delivery matters - don't apologize for the journey"
      - "Over-index on unit economics to counter pivot skepticism"

  - id: ps-003
    name: "International founder adapting deck for US investors"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder (Non-US based)"
    organization_context: "25-person Series A startup based in Europe, raising from US investors for the first time"
    situation: |
      Anika (CEO) runs a fintech from Berlin. She's raised €5M from European 
      investors and has €2M ARR. Now raising $15M Series B with US lead. Her 
      European deck worked well locally, but early US conversations feel off. 
      Investors ask questions she didn't expect: "What's your US plan?" "Why 
      aren't you growing faster?" "How does European regulation affect us?"
    trigger: "First 5 US investor meetings underperformed; need to adapt approach"
    actions: |
      1. Anika gets feedback from a US-based advisor: "Your deck is too modest. 
         European decks undersell, US investors expect confidence." Example: her 
         deck says "solid growth," US expectation is "explosive growth."
      2. Adjusts language throughout:
         - "Steady 15% m/m" → "Consistent 15% monthly growth, compounding to 5x annually"
         - "Strong retention" → "93% net revenue retention, expanding within accounts"
         - "Experienced team" → "Team has built €500M+ in value across 3 exits"
      3. Adds explicit US slide: "Why US Now"
         - "Europe is proof of concept, US is scale market"
         - "Hiring US sales team Q3"
         - "3 US enterprise pilots already in progress"
      4. Changes market sizing: European investors cared about TAM. US investors 
         want to see US-specific TAM. Adds US market size and entry strategy.
      5. Addresses regulatory question head-on: creates slide on "Regulatory as 
         Moat" - how European compliance experience becomes competitive advantage 
         in US compliance requirements.
      6. Adjusts the ask: €15M in Europe would be "large Series B." In US framing, 
         positions as "efficient Series B to hit Series C metrics in 18 months."
      7. Practices with 2 US-based founders who've raised there. Their feedback: 
         "You're still too humble in person. Own the wins."
    outcome: |
      Raised $18M from US lead + European follow-on. The adaptation made significant 
      difference - post-close, lead investor said "I almost passed after first 
      meeting, but the second meeting felt like a different company." Key: same 
      substance, different presentation.
    lessons:
      - "US investor expectations differ - confidence, ambition, scale"
      - "Explicit US strategy is required - 'we'll figure it out' doesn't work"
      - "Turn potential weakness (foreign) into strength (regulatory moat)"
      - "Adjust language: modest → confident, steady → explosive"
      - "Practice with locals - cultural nuances matter"
      - "Same substance can feel like different company with right framing"

# Risks - What Can Go Wrong and How to Prevent/Handle
risks:
  execution_risks:
    - risk: "Deck is too long - loses investor attention"
      likelihood: high
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Ruthlessly cut to 12-15 slides for main deck. If you can't say it in 
        10-15 minutes, you don't know your story. Appendix exists for depth. 
        Test: can you pitch it in an elevator ride?
        
    - risk: "Metrics don't support the story"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Context > spin. If metrics are early, frame stage honestly: "At our 
        stage, we're focused on [leading indicators]." Show trajectory not 
        just snapshots. Never lie - investors will find out.
        
    - risk: "Generic deck that doesn't stand out"
      likelihood: high
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Be specific, not generic. "Our AI is 40% more accurate" not "cutting-edge 
        AI." Include specific examples, customer quotes, real numbers. Generic 
        decks are forgotten immediately.
        
    - risk: "Beautiful design, unclear story"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: high
      mitigation: |
        Nail content before design. If you can't explain each slide verbally, 
        it shouldn't exist. Design enhances clarity, doesn't replace it. 
        Headlines should tell the story.
        
    - risk: "Different versions cause confusion"
      likelihood: medium
      impact: medium
      mitigation: |
        Clear version control: "V12-March-Full" naming convention. Track which 
        investor received which version. Update all versions together for 
        material changes.
        
  organizational_risks:
    - risk: "Deck promises what company can't deliver"
      impact: |
        Investors feel misled during diligence. Trust is lost. Even if term 
        sheet happens, relationship starts poorly. Reputation damage spreads 
        in investor community.
      prevention: |
        Every claim should be supportable in diligence. "Projections" should be 
        defensible with assumptions. Have team review for accuracy. Better to 
        underpromise than be caught exaggerating.
        
    - risk: "Founder can't deliver the deck in person"
      impact: |
        Deck is beautiful, but pitch is weak. Investors invest in people, not 
        slides. Disconnect between deck quality and founder presence raises 
        red flags about operational ability.
      prevention: |
        Practice relentlessly. Present to advisors, team, mirror. Record and 
        watch. CEO must own the story - not delegate to more polished speaker. 
        Authenticity > polish.
