definition:
  purpose: |
    Term sheet negotiations determine not just how much money you raise, but 
    the fundamental structure of your relationship with investors. A term 
    sheet sets the rules for who controls what, who gets paid when, and what 
    happens when things go wrong.
    
    Founders often focus exclusively on valuation, but experienced founders 
    know that control terms, protective provisions, and governance can matter 
    more than the headline number. A great valuation with terrible terms can 
    be worse than a lower valuation with founder-friendly terms.
    
    This is also a relationship negotiation. How investors negotiate term 
    sheets signals how they'll behave as board members. Aggressive tactics 
    at term sheet stage often predict difficult board dynamics.
    
    Warning signs of poor term sheet negotiation:
    - Signing the first term sheet without understanding alternatives
    - Focusing only on valuation, ignoring control and liquidation terms
    - Not understanding what you're giving up
    - Negotiating alone against experienced investors with lawyers
    
  outcome: |
    A signed term sheet with economics that work for the business, governance 
    that preserves founder control where it matters, and terms that align 
    investor and founder incentives. Both sides should feel the deal is fair.

  - id: ps-001
    name: "First-Time Founder Negotiating Seed Term Sheet"
    practitioner: "CEO / Founder"
    organization_context: |
      Solo technical founder raising first institutional round. Strong 
      product and early traction, but no fundraising experience. Received 
      first term sheet from seed fund.
    situation: |
      Got term sheet from reputable seed fund. Excited but overwhelmed. 
      Terms look reasonable at first glance but founder doesn't know what's 
      standard. No competing term sheets yet. 60 days of runway remaining.
    trigger: |
      VC partner sent term sheet after positive partner meeting. Asked for 
      response within a week.
    actions: |
      1. Resisted urge to sign immediately despite excitement and runway 
         pressure. Asked for 5 days to review (not 7 - showed urgency).
      2. Spent 6 hours reading about term sheets: NVCA docs, blog posts, 
         Y Combinator safe resources. Made list of terms didn't understand.
      3. Called two angel investors for introductions to lawyers. Engaged 
         startup lawyer for term sheet review ($5K fixed fee).
      4. Created cap table model with scenarios. Discovered option pool ask 
         (20%) was aggressive for hiring plan (needed 12%).
      5. Lawyer identified three issues: (a) pool too big, (b) protective 
         provisions included budget approval, (c) participating preferred.
      6. Made list of priorities: must-fix participating preferred, want to 
         fix pool size, would like narrower protective provisions.
      7. Sent markup with explanations: participating → non-participating 
         (market standard), 20% pool → 15% (here's hiring plan), remove 
         budget approval (operational constraint).
      8. Negotiated over two calls. Got non-participating, 15% pool. 
         Investor kept one protective provision (reasonable compromise).
      9. Signed term sheet day 6. Started due diligence immediately.
    outcome: |
      Closed round 5 weeks later. Non-participating preferred became 
      standard for all future rounds. 5% option pool savings meant 
      meaningful equity retained. Protective provision removal prevented 
      future operational conflicts.
    lessons:
      - First term sheet feels urgent but rarely is - take time to learn
      - Lawyers pay for themselves in first negotiation
      - Option pool fights are worth having with data
      - Participating preferred compounds over rounds - never accept

    name: "CEO Running Competitive Series A Process"
    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: |
      B2B SaaS company, 35 employees, $3M ARR growing 3x YoY. Multiple 
      Series A investors interested. CEO has raised before (seed round) 
      and has experienced board member as advisor.
    situation: |
      Generated strong interest from 5 firms. Two have sent term sheets, 
      three are preparing to. Need to manage competitive process without 
      burning relationships or creating chaos.
    trigger: |
      First term sheet arrived from top-tier firm. Second arrived 48 hours 
      later from another strong firm. Three more expected within a week.
    actions: |
      1. Created term sheet tracking matrix: rows = investors, columns = 
         key terms. Filled in as term sheets arrived.
      2. Thanked first investor for term sheet, said reviewing with board 
         and would respond within 7 days. Honest about competitive process.
      3. Used matrix to compare: Firm A offered higher valuation; Firm B 
         offered better terms (non-participating, smaller pool). Firm B's 
         total economic package was actually better despite lower headline.
      4. Calculated cap table scenarios for each term sheet. Modeled 
         exit outcomes at $100M, $250M, $500M for each structure.
      5. Called references on each lead partner. Firm A partner had mixed 
         reviews ("pushes hard on board"); Firm B partner got raves.
      6. With board advisor, developed negotiation strategy: Use Firm B's 
         better terms to improve Firm A's offer, or go with Firm B.
      7. Communicated transparently: told Firm A that another term sheet 
         had better terms on specific dimensions. Asked if they could 
         improve. Gave them 3 days.
      8. Firm A improved some terms but not all. Decision came down to 
         partner relationship. Chose Firm B for better terms and 
         better references.
      9. Let other firms know decision. Thanked everyone. Offered to 
         stay in touch for future rounds.
    outcome: |
      Signed with Firm B. Better terms saved ~$2M in dilution over the 
      life of company. Partner relationship proved excellent during 
      difficult period two years later. Maintained relationships with 
      others firms for Series B.
    lessons:
      - Competitive process improves terms but must be managed carefully
      - Headline valuation matters less than total economic package
      - References on investors are as important as references on employees
      - How investors behave in negotiation predicts board behavior

    practitioner: "CEO"
    organization_context: |
      Consumer startup, 20 employees. Raised seed 18 months ago. 
      Growth slower than expected. 4 months runway. Need bridge to 
      reach Series A metrics but negotiating from weak position.
    situation: |
      Lead seed investor willing to do bridge round but terms are 
      aggressive: 2x liquidation preference, full ratchet anti-dilution, 
      board seat that gives investors majority. CEO knows terms are bad 
      but needs the money.
    trigger: |
      Investor sent term sheet for $1M bridge. 48-hour deadline to sign 
      "or we'll need to discuss other options." Runway is 4 months.
    actions: |
      1. Took deep breath. Recognized investor was using runway pressure 
         as negotiating tactic. Deadline was artificial.
      2. Modeled scenarios: what happens if take this deal vs. cut costs 
         and extend runway vs. try to find alternative bridge.
      3. Identified the critical issues: 2x preference and full ratchet 
         would crush Series A economics. Board majority was concerning 
         but manageable.
      4. Called other investors in cap table. One angel offered to put 
         in $150K. Another offered $100K. Suddenly had $250K alternative.
      5. Responded to lead investor: "We appreciate the offer but these 
         terms don't work for us. Specifically, the 2x preference and 
         full ratchet would create significant issues for Series A 
         investors. We have alternative interest at 1x non-participating."
      6. Investor pushed back. CEO held firm: "We'd rather take smaller 
         bridge on better terms than larger bridge that hurts future."
      7. After 4 days, investor came back: 1.5x preference, weighted 
         average anti-dilution. Still not perfect but acceptable.
      8. Negotiated board: agreed to board observer seat, not voting seat. 
         Preserved founder board majority.
      9. Signed revised term sheet. Used bridge to hit metrics. Raised 
         Series A 8 months later with clean terms.
    outcome: |
      Series A investors later said they almost passed due to bridge 
      terms even at 1.5x preference. If had accepted 2x and full ratchet, 
      would have been unfundable. Bridge extended runway enough to 
      prove metrics. Raised $8M Series A at 3x higher valuation than 
      bridge implied.
    lessons:
      - Desperate doesn't mean defenseless - always have alternatives
      - Bad bridge terms can kill Series A options
      - Artificial deadlines are negotiating tactics
      - Sometimes smaller bridge on better terms beats larger bridge on bad terms
