# EPF v1.13.0 - Living Reality Assessment Template
# Living Reality Assessment (AIM Baseline)
# This is the persistent "ground truth" document that evolves through emergence.
# Initially created during bootstrap (Cycle 0), updated via THA signals during AIM.
#
# Lifecycle: bootstrap → maturing → evolved
# Key principle: This document reflects reality, not plans.
# Updates flow FROM execution signals, not TO-DO speculation.
