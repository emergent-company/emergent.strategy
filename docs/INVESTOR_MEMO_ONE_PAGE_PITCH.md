# Emergent: One-Page Pitch
**The Intelligence Layer for AI-Native Development**

---

## 🎯 The Problem
**AI tools are smart but blind.**
- 92% of developers use AI coding tools (Cursor, Copilot, Claude)
- But these tools lack organizational context—they don't know:
  - What you're building (product strategy)
  - Why decisions were made (architecture, tradeoffs)
  - How knowledge connects (relationships, dependencies)

**Result**: Context-switching is the #1 productivity killer (70% of developers)

---

## 💡 The Solution
**Emergent: The context layer connecting strategy → knowledge → code**

Three integrated products:
1. **Emergent Core**: Knowledge engine (search, graphs, AI chat with citations)
2. **Emergent Frameworks**: EPF methodology (git-native strategy artifacts)
3. **Emergent Tools**: MCP integration (expose context to AI agents)

**Value**: AI agents with Emergent context show **40%+ better task completion**

---

## 📊 Market Opportunity
- **TAM**: $50B+ enterprise knowledge management
- **SAM**: $5-10B AI-augmented knowledge (20-30% growth)
- **SOM**: $50-100M developer-friendly API platforms

**Timing**: 18-24 month window to own "context layer" before incumbents catch up

---

## 🏆 Competitive Advantage

### We Beat Enterprise Solutions
**vs. Glean, Microsoft Copilot**
- Developer-friendly API-first (not enterprise-sales-first)
- Cross-platform (not ecosystem lock-in)

### We Beat Consumer Tools
**vs. Google NotebookLM**
- "NotebookLM with the hood open"
- Configurable, self-hostable, multi-tenant
- Full API access + MCP integration

### We Beat Open-Source
**vs. Dify, Danswer, GraphRAG**
- Productized knowledge graphs (not flat search or libraries)
- Managed service (not DIY infrastructure)
- Ecosystem integration (EPF + MCP)

**Our Moats**: MCP-first architecture, knowledge graph + vector hybrid, EPF methodology network effects

## 🚀 Traction & Roadmap

### Current State (Dec 2025)
✅ Working product in production  
✅ 40%+ AI improvement validated  
✅ Dogfooding: Emergent builds Emergent  
✅ MCP server functional  

### Q1 2025 Goals
- 3 design partners active
- MCP integration live
- EPF self-hosting complete
- Product-market fit signals validated

### 3-Year Vision
- **2025**: 100 teams (beachhead)
- **2026**: 500 organizations (expansion)
- **2027**: 2,000 organizations (scale)
- **2028**: 5,000+ organizations (market leadership)

---

## 👥 Team
**Eyedea / TwentyFirst Engineering Team**
- Deep AI/ML expertise (LLMs, RAG, embeddings)
- Production experience with semantic search and knowledge graphs
- Modern architecture (multi-tenant from day 1)
- Proven track record delivering AI systems

**Execution Edge**: Dogfooding creates tight feedback loops and rapid iteration

---

## 💵 The Ask
**Seed Round: $1-2M**

**Allocation**:
- 40% Product (engineering team expansion, MCP, enterprise features)
- 30% GTM (design partners, content, community)
- 20% Ops (customer success, feedback loops)
- 10% Reserve (18-24 month runway)

**Use**: Accelerate from beachhead to scale, hire 4 key roles (engineer, DevRel, designer, CS lead)

---

## 📈 Financial Projections

| Year | Orgs | MRR | ARR |
|------|------|-----|-----|
| 2025 | 100 | $50K | ~$200K |
| 2026 | 500 | $250K | ~$2M |
| 2027 | 2,000 | $750K | ~$7M |
| 2028+ | 5,000+ | - | $20M+ |

**North Star**: AI Task Completion Rate (+50% target)

---

## ⚠️ Key Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Big tech bundling | Cross-platform, open ecosystem |
| Well-funded competitors | Win on developer experience |
| DIY solutions | Value in quality + managed service |
| Small team execution | Ruthless focus, strategic hiring |

---

## 🎯 Why Now?

✅ **Market ready**: Enterprise AI budgets shifting to implementation  
✅ **Tech mature**: LLMs commoditized, RAG proven, MCP emerging  
✅ **User demand**: Universal frustration with context-blind AI  
✅ **Window open**: 18-24 months before incumbents respond
